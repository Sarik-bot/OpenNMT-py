 he 's a funny guy , too .

 i 've got to take a break . when we come back , we 'll ask marianne about fear in faith . just thought of that one .
 hi .
to set up a software program ?
 thank you very much . thank you , sam nunn . thank you , bob strauss . and as you see , the people applauding outside the eisenhower executive office building in washington , applauding vice president al gore and senator joe lieberman . they 're both in that building.and we are expecting -- and there you see him now as al gore leaves . a lot of people out on a cold night in washington to bid his good wishes.he spoke for about 7 minutes . and again , governor bush , the president-elect , will be speaking about 37 minutes from now . you will see that and we 'll be back with another edition of larry king live.when we come back , senator orrin hatch and senator john breaux , two powerful members of the united states senate . senator hatch is the chair of the judiciary committee , a committee that al gore once sat on , will be our guests as al gore now leaves and heads back to the vice presidential residence.first most difficult task of his life was when his father , the late senator , spoke out against the war in vietnam -- al gore thought it would be best if he would go to the service and go to that war to help his father . his father would subsequently lose that election.and that 's tipper gore right in front.sometimes in defeat , people gain more popularity , and apparently , that is happening to al gore tonight . and i think it would be safe to say that that speech will be heralded tomorrow , even by his severest critics during this campaign , as a gracious , classy , at times funny , timely concession speech.they seem to be chanting something . i ca n't hear it.they 're saying '' gore in four ! '' i am told , meaning , al , come back in four years to run again . he 's in the car waving goodbye . and as he waves goodbye , we 'll take a break and then come back with senator orrin hatch of utah , senator john breaux of louisiana.this is larry king live , part one . do n't go away .we 're back and we now welcome to larry king live part one senator orrin hatch of utah , senator john breaux of louisiana . senator hatch a member of the opposition to the candidacy of vice president gore.what did you make of his speech ? no matter who won , it -- we were going to get good people , and four really fine wives and families . i just have to commend them all.and i commend vice president gore . i thought that was a very , very eloquent speech . i meant a lot to , i think , this country , and he -- he called for all of us to unite president-elect bush . and it was gracious . it was just about everything i think it should have been .senator breaux , did it surprise you ? and i think tonight you saw an al gore who has devoted his life to public service , sees that political life ending , at least for the time being , yet he was eloquent , he was gracious . he was very helpful to this country , and i think he was particularly helpful to president- elect george bush .and do you think , senator hatch , all this talk of bipartisanship and this kind of mood can continue ?
 oh , they were n't happening when making ...

'' he 's really , really working towards a mine land treaty ban , where as we do n't get that response from bush at all . it 's like , we will try not to hurt noncombatants .are you saying the united states is disappointing you ?

 e-mail question from joyce in winstead , connecticut : '' did you get a chance to ask questions of michelle obama or cindy mccain off camera ? did they hang out with the co-hosts at all ? or were they whisked away by security ? '' behar : no , see that was my point . i was just making that exact point , that michelle is a hangout kind of girl . and after the show was over , she was basically mobbed by producers and interns and everybody else , and even the right wingers on the show wanted to take a picture with michelle . and she was quite gracious . she took a picture with everybody , and she smiled . she posed . i mean , she was taller than everybody except bill getty , who is the executive producer . she 's very tall . so we all sort of felt short next to her . but everybody was charmed by her , i must say .what do you make of cookie-gate , that is cindy mccain did , for '' family circle magazine , '' did an oatmeal butterscotch cookie recipe virtually identical to a hershey 's recipe . what do you make of this possible scandal , which will reap talk radio , where they have nothing else to do , tomorrow ?

subject .
 let me take a break , and we 're going pick up with ron and then with others , and i 'm going to quote a critique , a strong critique of what everybody is doing tonight in the current issue of the '' new yorker '' and get our guests to comment on it . we 'll be including your phone calls as well . this is larry king live . the panel has just begun . do n't go away .we 'd like to have everybody 's opinion on this , but i 'll start with ron insana , since he 's mentioned in the article . there 's an article in the current '' new yorker '' by james surowiecki in which compares the way this is covered . so , this zeros in on maria , allan and ron , by the networks , and it has sort of like ron insana in a irwin allen disaster film . he 's standing on the floor and everything is going to pot.and james writes : '' the funny thing was nothing really seemed to have provoked any panic . oh , people were apparently worried the japanese banks were going under , but we 've known that for a very long time . so , what was going on ? people were selling because other people were selling . they were afraid because they were being told that everyone was afraid.watching cnbc those two days provided a lesson in how pointless minute-by-minute coverage of the stock market is . it distorts the way the market works , helps turn what should be a diverse , independent- thinking crowd of investors into a herd acting upon a single collective thought . in this case , sell . as a rule , the more information markets have , the better . but often what cnbc and the other pillars of market information journalism offer is not information , it 's noise '' -- ron .
 stumbling toward the light ?
 for you ?

 when we return , how would cold warrior ronald reagan deal with today 's international hot spots ? insights ahead on this special edition of larry king live .we 're back at the ronald reagan library . the world is a dangerous place today ; security is a big issue . there was plenty of international danger in the '80s , too . the cold war continued , and the soviet union remained america 's global rival . but ronald reagan came to the presidency convinced that communism would wind up on the ash heap of history.not many shared his view . even fewer would have dreamed that he 'd find common ground with the leader of the evil empire .the liking of gorbachev , was that a real sense of affection ? did you like like him ?

 a picture of his cousin ...
 john king , is barack obama one of the amazing political stories of your tenure ? have you covered anything like this ?nothing with the potential of this . we do n't know if he will reach that potential yet . larry , months and months ago i was talking with the veteran democratic pollster peter hart , one of the smartest men in the business . he said this is a guy who has the potential to be the next bobby kennedy , who has the potential to unite people , to rise above it , to where the traditional rules do n't necessarily apply once you get the support . the only question was , could he keep the flame burning . he was very inspirational tonight . he has grown as a candidate . the question is , can he sustain it now ? now , bob woodward made a fascinating and telling point earlier tonight when he said you learn a lot about a politician when they lose.hillary clinton in elected politics has had a short career . she has never lost before . her husband lost as governor of arkansas . it made him a better candidate and a much better politician . he got up off the ground and he learned from that defeat . can she learn from that defeat ? larry , she has only five do to it.it is very hard , if hillary clinton loses two in a row , especially if she is in third place in iowa , very hard to see her coming back . especially , again , because then barack obama goes into better territory . watching hillary clinton to see if she can learn from losing and learn fast is fascinating.the other big thing to watch is john mccain has a second chance . he blew his first chance . he was the republican front runner earlier on . he has a chance now in new hampshire . if he can win in new hampshire , to have a race where he can try to take control of the republican party again . the obstacles are many . immigration issues still hurt him . he is very short on money . but john mccain , as mike huckabee has a chance to redefine the republican party , john mccain has a chance for revival.larry , this is fascinating .well put . a fascinating five days ahead . wolf blitzer and john king , they are part of the best political team on television . when we come back , bob woodward , david gergen and candy crowley . do n't go away .
 it 's so hard .
 so you do n't know what you 're going to do tomorrow ?

 neither of you would wait until september ?
 did they see any autopsy results ?
 that was funny .
 is it true that you want to take the show more serious as well ?
 what was your role ? what was the role of the humvee ? mcwhinnie : the role of the humvee was to get the news back of the war back to cnn , so we had a satellite dish and a roving satellite so we could feed live while the vehicle was on the go during the course of the war .scottie , is that vehicle , for want of a better term , like a tank ? mcwhinnie : not in the slightest . it was n't even armor-plated , so if we 'd have hit something or if a bullet had gone in , we 'd have been toast , really . but it was our home for , like , a month .not much gas mileage , right ? mcwhinnie : no . that was when it was working , actually . it broke down most of the time . so we did quite well out of gas , yes .so whoever buys warrior one is buying this as a relic , as a kind of a symbol of status -- or , you 've got it all working now ? mcwhinnie : yes , warrior one is done up -- it 's like a customized vehicle . if i had the cash , i would definitely buy it . it 's got a brand new engine in it ; it 's looking really sharp . but it was a heap of junk when we were driving it .it underwent some major renovations as part of a learning channel show called '' overhaulin ' . '' a dvd player has been added , along with four televisions , a high-end sound system , a snazzy-looking paint job . it was n't luxurious in the iraqi desert , but the person who gets it will get a full , top-running machine , right ? mcwhinnie : right , yes , it has had a lot of surgery done to it . it was like just , i said , just about worked when we had it , but it has been totally overhauled for the program , and the proceeds go to this fisher house , which you have been talking about this evening . so it should -- i mean , it 's worth a fortune , i think , at the moment .i hope we get a lot of money for it . what do you think of this , ken , this idea ?
 no regrets about not going to iowa ?
 i mean why ?
 i mean it . philadelphia , hello ?

 yes , you would think ?
 jackie moved to new york in 1964. were you in new york then , too ?
 and why was that not effective ?
 what were you looking for ...
 tell me what do you think ? hunter : i think that that 's fine . i think talking to north korea is good but i think that the secretary is wrong in this respect . what we owe to the american people is an insurance policy and that insurance policy has to presume that perhaps words wo n't work and perhaps the six party talks wo n't work and perhaps continued diplomacy wo n't work.and at some point we 're going to have a missile , perhaps launched at the united states that does n't fall short , that is n't defective . and the way you handle that is by having a missile defense , that is having the physical capability of intercepting a missile that is coming into an american city.and that 's where this president has been strong and that 's where this congress has solidly been behind him . we 're spending enough money a year to get this system up . we need to have a limited capability against incoming missiles . we live in an age of missiles.and with respect to diplomacy it 's very tough to negotiate a stable agreement with an unstable leadership . and right now i think most people would describe the north korean leadership as being unstable .richard roth is cnn 's senior united nations correspondent . he 's been doing that for a long time . what 's going to happen tomorrow ?
 do you think this is going to end soon or not ?

 we 'll be right back with cybill shepherd , who does n't lie anymore . do n't go away .
 so you never talked to the man that he 's living with ?
 so there is no doubt in your mind , barbara , that he would prosecute fully those who may protest violently at abortion centers even though he so is pro-life ?
 i want to take a break.and when we come back we 'll ask you , what is at stake for the united states ? what is the fear of the united states happening in iraq that causes us to possibly take this action ? we 'll be right back with the secretary of state , and then we 'll be hearing from trent lott , and then we 'll be hearing from joe biden.secretary of state powell , and more with him right after this . do n't go away .we 're back with secretary of state colin powell . mr. secretary , no state likes to start a war , so the obvious is what is the threat to this state , the united states , in starting it ? what can he do to us ?

 her name is sugar ?
 is it difficult for you to comment in on clients you do n't examine ?
 but you were still using ?
 ron brownstein , is there any good that can come of this ? brownstein : yes , do i think that something along the lines of what dan schorr was talking about . i mean , the fact is this election showed that the country is about as evenly divided between the parties as it 's been in the last hundred years . we have a 50/50 senate . if bush wins , it would be the second narrowest electoral college majority ever . and the fact is that neither party can roll the other . the only was to get things done is to establish bipartisan cooperation in congress and in the country and i think this whole incredible episode has to sober the winner . sober the winner into doing things like appointing people from the other party to their cabinet , maybe even adopting some of the ideas of the loser . maybe even giving the loser a job , you know , like franklin roosevelt did with wendell wilkie after 1940.but they 're going to have to find ways to reach across party lines because one side simply does n't have enough strength to roll the other in this environment .extremes then , ron , of the right and left will be diminished ?

 did you want to go or were you forced to go ? conner : i wanted to go . you know , at the time , it was kind of -- i would say at the very beginning , it was a force thing , but they did n't force me because they said it 's either this or you , you know , or this . as i said , well , i 'll take rehab . and i even think i made the comment i 'll take any free therapy that i can get , which was ridiculous.but going into it , you know , i went in with open arms . i knew that i had hit my bottom . i saw every bad thing that you could see on me and that i could see in myself written in front of me.and so it 's kind of hard not to take a look at that and say , you know , there 's obviously something not right here with me , you know ? and i -- everyone had turned their back against me , even the people i worked with . everyone in the miss . usa organization had basically washed their hands . and the only person that did n't wash their hands of me was mr. trump.so now i can tell you , coming out of rehab , i have a very , very big support system through them . and , you know , i -- things can change . people can change .how wild were you living in new york ?

 i won a peabody in new york . we won two pea bodies , one for radio , one for television .
 so there is a lot of it .
 and yet , peter , there are these claims of responsibility including a video reportedly from the pakistani taliban . how do you sort through what is just noise and what is true ? peter bergen , cnn national security analyst : well , often there are claims of responsibility , you may recall , john , when the blackout happened on the east coast . a group calling itself the abdullah azzam brigade said they were responsible . so that was nonsense . so it 's very unlikely the pakistani taliban would have put together an operation like this in 13 days as they claimed . however , the fact that this guy might have been inspired by al qaeda 's ideas or this conspiracy , john , i think it 's more than one person . typically when we see a sort of car bomb operation like this , it 's not usually a solo operator who 's put it together .professor kushner , what jumps out at you in the early hours as you hear more details about the investigation ?
 do blacks work there ?
 one of the times i interviewed sinatra and asked what i thought about he did that was he special . and he said he does n't know . he says , '' because when i listen to steve lawrence , or i listen to tony bennett , they 're just as good as me . i do n't know what i 'm doing different . they 're just as good .

'' let me take you down '' is available from billard books and takes us inside the crime and the criminal . the author joins us here in washington.we just spent 40 minutes with chapman , removed somewhat by satellite in attica . you were with him .

 kent , the problem seems like humongous . i mean it seems like overwhelming.do you ever get that feeling ?
 did you fly back to stockton ?
 all rightnow , governor barbour , in that regard , though , obama seems to have shifted . he now backs the idea of tapping into strategic petroleum reserves and says he could support limited offshore drilling.what do you make of that ? and americans are very reasonable people . they know if you want the price of something to come down , make the supply go up . yet for 30 years , as john mccain said , democrats in washington have been fighting against production of more domestic oil and gas , against drilling offshore , against anwar , against more nuclear power , against more production of oil and gas from shale out in the federal lands and the west.we 've got to produce more domestic energy , including oil and gas , nuclear , clean coal . and we do have to conserve . there 's no question about that . that 's one of the things that will work quickly.but we 've got to get the supply up of domestic energy if we 're going to wean ourselves off too much foreign oil .professor reich , does n't that seem logical ?

and you ca n't move ?
 in 1980 , ted kennedy ran for president . almost got the party 's nomination , barely losing to the incumbent jimmy carter . kennedy 's speech at the convention and the reaction on the floor is the stuff that political legends are made of . ted kennedy had the gift of public eloquence . when he spoke out in the spotlight of major public events , people listened . let 's look at some of those moments now , starting with the 1980 democratic convention .

 we will take a break and come right back . do n't leave us , dan walker , the grandfather of christian walker . how would you like to be in a position like that , to hope that this beautiful young boy was a kidnapping victim , which may be the only reason he would be alive . we 'll be right back .we 're back on larry king live . with us in banda aceh , indonesia is tom alcedo , field office director for save the children in indonesia . in houston , texas is padmini nathan , president of helping hands usa . in phuket , thailand , is dan walker , grandfather of the missing christian walker who has been on a rollercoaster . in phuket , thailand as well is our reporter aneesh raman . in new york is charles lyons , president of the u.s. fund for unicef . dan , how have you dealt with this rollercoaster you 've been on ? they found him , they did n't find him . a man visited him , it was n't the man . now he 's missing , now we hope he 's kidnapped . how are you dealing with all of this ? dan walker , grandfather : well , we believe or -- we 've chased down a number of leads that turned out to be false leads with regard to finding christian . we chased down this lead that we had at the hospital -- rather at the hotel . we 've gotten together with mr. stefan ( ph ) who had a number of children , one of whom he took to the hospital and reunited with his mother.at the moment , we 're hoping that the thai tourist police are going to talk to the doctor , one of the two doctors at the hospital , to a police artist who is going to try to draw a sketch of the man , the caucasian man , that brought christian to the hospital twice.the two doctors and one nurse at that hospital are quite certain it was n't another swedish boy with blonde hair and blue eyes . we have quite good photographs . they said it was this boy that was in the hospital . this is a very good likeness of christian . taken only about a year ago . and this is a picture of his mother , madeline . the mother of the three children.going to all the hospitals , looking at all the lists , going to all the mortuaries , we have found absolutely no trace of madeline , the mother . however , we have this one lead still at the hospital where two nurse and doctors and a nurse feel quite certain that it was christian and not some other blue-eyed , blonde boy that was there twice with this man.so now we 're trying to get a more complete description through a police artist of what the man -- all we know about him is that he had a red shirt and a mustache and he was caucasian .aneesh raman in phuket , does it surprise you to learn that the thai police are being so cooperative in this individual matter ?

 hugo ? vickers : i do n't know because i was n't at the party , i 'm afraid . but he would have been a very welcome guest . but i would like to pick up , if i could , on that point about prince philip . the interesting thing about the funeral procession was that , as i understand it , there was some question in prince william 's mind as to whether or not he really wanted to take part in all that and to walk behind his mother 's coffin so publicly after all the shenanigans that had been going on in the press . and prince philip is a very wise man , and he said to prince william , i think that you might regret it later if you do n't . and then he offered to walk with them . and i think that 's an extremely supportive grandfather . and that 's really , i think , how it happened .logan , ohio . hello .
 they do n't need motive ? copeland : they 're not going to need motive to convict her , larry , of murder . but they certainly will need to know whether or not she engaged in this with -- with sound mind.the essential element is -- look , these are -- there are special circumstances involved in this case . that is , that there was a kidnapping associated with the murder , that there was a rape associated with the murder and that perhaps it was even premeditated.now , if i 'm her defense lawyer , what i 'm concerned about is what this woman 's mental state is in terms of establishing whether or not there is a motive.now , she does n't have to have a motive to kill . there does n't have to be a motive for her to be found guilty . but if i 'm going to defend her , then one of the first things that i 'm going to look to , larry , is whether or not she is of sound mind , whether or not she 's of some kind of mental diminished capacity.and , remember , at the end of that arraignment , her lawyer specifically said to the judge , he said , judge , you know , look , we 'd like to order another medical evaluation . and , remember , she 'd already had a medical evaluation over the course of the weekend.so clearly , what 's being suggested here is there 's something going on mentally with her .jennifer , did she appear remorseful ?

 senator biden , what 's your view ? and in addition to that , here 's what it comes down to . i say to bill safire , bill , we know we knew about this site . it was a prime site that we had targeted as the place where maybe nuclear weapons were being made , and yet nobody knew whether or not these weapons were missing according to the white house until october of this year . that 's what the white house is saying . that 's what scott mcclellan said . now , i ask you , why did we not know ? is not that incompetence that we did n't go immediately to that site knowing it was a nuclear facility , knowing this stuff is the stuff of which you can detonate nuclear weapons , that is , a conventional explosive to ram together two pieces of highly enriched uranium to cause a thermo-nuclear explosion , and we knew there were over 300 tons of it , why did someone not go and see if it was still there ?
 your wife ?
 drew griffin , just yesterday , the governor just yesterday had this to say about the idea of somebody wire-tapping him . watch him and comment . you might hear a couple of words that you might not hear publicly but those are only adjectives to describe maybe some of you . but -- and you 'll hear probably a lot of discussions about the cubs and some of my ideas on what they ought to do in the off season.but , you know , this is america . you know ? and i appreciate it if you want to tape my conversations , give me a head 's up and let me know .drew , he has a bit of a charm about him , does he not ?

 before we talk about the book and how to let go , one of the hardest things to do by the way is letting go . not one more thing before you go but letting go . you knew this pope , did you not ? shriver : yes . well , i met this pope . i was n't like friendly with him or anything . i met him about 15 years ago . my parents brought us to rome . we had the honor of meeting him . when he walked into the room , it was one of those moments -- he walked in and i almost burst into tears . i could feel my eyes well up at just the sight of him . you could n't really explain why . he walked in with his white vestments on , and he spoke to each one of us and he talked about prayer . and my father kept asking him about , what should we be praying for ? because my father 's a deeply -- both my parents are deeply religious people , go to mass every single day . and are strong believers in the power of prayer . and the pope talked to my dad and to us about praying to mary because he was obviously a huge fan of the blessed mary .mary was his -- they put m on the casket .

 ball games , ballet . was it hard for you ? you regret that ?

 let 's listen in to the floor on the senate and check as it goes.if that , in fact , is the case , we 'll do that . but people may not sit at their chairs , because other people have -- after they vote , they can depart the chamber.mr . president , we 'll be in session tomorrow . there will be minor business transacted . it will be morning business . and we 'll try to clear some bills that we can.the -- we 'll see friday . we 'll see what the house does . they 're coming back into session tomorrow . so we 're going to have to be in session until a decision is made , when the house can take up the legislation.everyone should understand , the week of november 17th is where we 're going to have our organizational meetings . and we will be in session several days during that period of time . and we will tell everyone all about this.with the one thing we 're going to move to is a lands package . and we talked to everybody about that . it 's something that senator bingaman and senator salazar have talked to many of you about.but to see what business will be conducted , we 'll have to wait and see what , if anything , the house does . if they do n't do anything , we ca n't do anything . so we will see what they do . so members should keep that time open .ok , we 'll hear from jessica yellin with the official concept of the vote.ben saying you heard they had 75 votes .
 paul begala , this may sound naive , why was that so important ? secrecy ? why ?
 senator kerrey , what 's your look ahead to november 2 ? how close ? what 's going to happen ? kerrey : well , first of all , i agree with candy . i mean , i do think that both men did well tonight , though again , as i said earlier , larry , i think on substance , both on iraq , on domestic policy , i think it 's much more likely that kerry is going to have the majority of americans and the majority of electoral votes on his side . i mean , you really ca n't make the case that there were n't mistakes made in iraq . just ca n't make that case . and as i said earlier , it 's not a question of angering the rest of the world . right now you 've got a majority of americans who are opposing this war . it 's going to be much harder to keep public opinion in the united states . he 's got almost three-fourths of our infantry divisions tied down in iraq . if something happens in iran or south korea , or north korea , we 're going to have to outsource that to somebody else . we do n't have the kind of capability , as a consequence , both of us going in afghanistan and iraq.so as well on the domestic issues . the president 's fiscal policy has been horrible , his environmental policy , his job record , and especially responding to what globalism is doing to the middle class . no real , serious effort to do something about health insurance . no real , serious effort to do something about education . i mean , you 've got the middle class under assault as a consequence of what globalism is doing . and at least senator kerry has an aggressive response in health and education .do you think he 's going to be a clear winner on november 2 ?
 i 'm a g now , right ?
 why , how do you know ?
 but it was the same opinion as governor bush 's . why was n't his opinion driven by politics ?
and do you still think all that is one god ? grahami do . and dr. townes ( ph ) of berkeley who is a great astronomist and physicist who was here at cornell for some years , he said that there is no way you can explain it except there was a beginning somewhere with someone . and he said you have to come to the point that there must be a god . and that to me was quite a statement coming from him , because he had won the noble peace for ...physics .

 somebody . is he still around ?
 the perception can be improved .
 com ci , come ca ?
 how are you coping with it ?
 do you still think he 's a little nuts to do this ?
 he 's trying to agree with you .
 he is -- we were in -- when we first started dating , we were in washington , d.c. , he has to run into the store and grab something . there 's a very small parking spot . he 's in his jumbo car . he starts to edge in , bumps the car in front of him , backs up , bumps the car behind him , is getting frustrated , bumps the car in front of him harder , bumps the car behind , bump , bump , bump , bump , bump , bump , bump.and a cop finally comes up and pounds on the door , it 's pouring rain , and larry rolls the window down and the cop says , '' mr. king , what are you doing ?

 the navy movie .
 thanks , jeff . jeff will be back at the top of the hour to join the panel , he 'll be here throughout , analysis throughout the evening , along with judy woodruff.when we come back , we 'll get the thoughts on all of this from senator john warner and senator john kerry , and then our panel will assemble . do n't go away .we are back , and we welcome senator john warner , republican of virginia , he is with us at our studios in washington ; and senator john kerry , democrat of massachusetts , with us at our studios in boston . senator kerry , what did you make of the governor 's remarks ? and he knows from the -- as does every republican -- from the entire tenor of the last two weeks that votes are being seriously contested , 10,750 votes were run through machines , but have not even been hand counted at this moment in miami-dade county . they counted the first 22 percent and it showed a gain of 157 votes for al gore . if you counted the other 78 percent and extrapolated what has been counted , gore wins this election . this election is now going to the court system of the nation.and i think that governor bush would have been far better advised tonight to thank florida for the certification , but to speak to america about the need to respect the legal process , to lower the voices , all the politicians quiet down and let the courts make their decision .all right , let me get -- there is the president , the president-elect maybe -- i do n't know what we 'll call it -- the governor of the state of texas returning to the mansion from the statehouse . senator warner , i would imagine your thoughts are different.but this country must march forward , and i regret the question about what would he do if he went to see president clinton -- i think just the opposite . i think president clinton would receive him . and indeed , president clinton knows that the transition is a vital thing and it has to get under way . there has already been a three-week delay -- let both candidates , if necessary , start a transition . but that should not be delayed , because america 's future is dependent on an orderly transition , and i think ...senator kerry . all right , i want -- we 've got limited time here , john .

'' or '' do we want to be in iraq without our major allies ? '' on all of these issues , americans are overwhelmingly liberal , again , even though they do n't call themselves liberals . and finally , george w. bush , one thing that he has accomplished is energizing and mobilizing liberals and progressives and democrats like no president has done so in years .is n't '' right-wing '' as bad a word as '' liberal ?

 i like obama-rama . dickie , what 's the big deal ? is it that the queen does n't touch people ? so as colleen said , it was a spontaneous gesture . what you 've got to remember is that the queen had been with the obamas , prior to walking into that reception , for about half an hour . the body chemistry and the body language had already been well-established . when they first meet , normally the queen sticks her hands out and you grab her fingers as a sort of shake your hand . this time , it was a very firm handshake . you can see right from the word go that this was a meeting that was going to click . absolutely , larry .june , what was the fuss ?

 what 's that , sancho ? do you want me to cut your hands off and use it as an ashtray ? yeah , i 'll put it out , providing you 're prepared to let me stub it out on your eyeball . i 'll put it out . agreeable ?i think '' sexy beast '' is a bit like hydra , you know , it has many heads . they 're not quite sure which one occupies that title at any given time . there are several sexy beasts on the -- in the film , you know , and the baton seems to be passed from one character to another .and basically it 's about ?it 's about , basically , it could have taken place 2,000 years ago , inasmuch as it is about tribal honor . and if you refuse to honor a certain tribal code , then the tribe will turn against you , will alienate you , will exile you , will destroy you . and my job on behalf of the tribe -- and they happen to be british criminals -- is to elicit the services of one man who can do this job for us , no other man can . and i 'm sent to recruit him from retirement . and it 's that struggle to get him back into our tribe .who plays that role ?ray winstone plays the man i have to get back to london to do this job .but you could have set it in any time ?i believe so , larry , because the characters -- because it 's so well written that the characters are archetypal . and i love archetypal mythology . and it 's like an ancient greek myth . it takes place on the mediterranean anyway in this great white blast of white light throughout most of the film .set in what time period ?1999 , 2000 -- you know ...now .now , yeah .and the title .'' sexy beast . ''was it always that title when you got the script ?always that title . that 's a kind of an expletive in england .oh , really .yeah , and it can be used descriptively for someone you find dangerously attractive and sexy .how do you select your roles ? i mean , is there a method ? do you say , if i like it ...there is a method . i mean , i ca n't always apply it , because sometimes i have to work because i 've got four children , et cetera , et cetera . if i recognize the man , or if i am curious to know more about the man , then i 'm well on the way to saying yes to the role . now don in '' sexy beast '' is an extremely violent , dangerous character , but there is something about him that i recognized , and something about him that made me very , very curious .do you enjoy evil parts ?you know , where i find don was very playable was that instead of playing the evil , i played his wound . because his wound was -- is what triggers his rage attacks . his wound is , i love you ; why do n't you love me ? it 's a sort of classic wound of unrequited love .so the evil person does n't look in the mirror and say , i 'm evil .strangely enough , there are scenes in this film where i act in the mirror . and that was a very interesting exercise . i shave , and i come out with this extreme invective , into the mirror . i 've never done that before ; i found it quite frightening .
 harder than '' forrest gump . ''

 correct .
 nicole kidman .
 does that make him , john , difficult to cover ?it makes him interesting and fascinating to cover . we sometimes want too much . we want them to spill everything at once . let 's watch as this unfolds . i think both chris and david make excellent points about this is an evolving chapter . he 's caught up in this moment . he knows the history . but , larry , i look at it this way : there are essentially two trains on the same track . one is all the hope and optimism and goodwill and popularity he has . the other is the economic anxiety that undermined mccain , undermined bush , and is growing right now still in the country . people -- i talked to more out here in ohio today -- they do n't trust these bail outs . they do n't know where the money is going . while they agree with obama you need to invest in economy , they 're worried about the price tag of that , too.my sense of this politically is both of those trains tracks are on the same track heading right at each other . he 's president on tuesday . when those trains collide , as people get impatient about the economy , does his popularity survive ?david , can we have too much expectancy ?

 congressman king , you and senator kirsten gillibrand , a democrat , are contacting other lawmakers and you 're urging them to include 20 million dollars in a fiscal appropriations bill for the continuation of the securing the cities initiative . what does that money do ?larry , this is a program which commissioner kelly started about five , six years ago . and it sets up radiation detectors on all the roads , tunnels , bridges leading into manhattan from the suburbs and the tri-state area , connecticut , new jersey , and new york . there is about 70 police and fire departments involved . it 's a very effective program . and yet , this year , the president , as i said , has cut off funding for it . and senator gillibrand and i , as well as congressman rangel , senator schumer , we are working in a bipartisan way to have that money resourced . it 's absolutely essential.and again , manhattan -- new york city is the target , but manhattan is the epicenter of new york . and that 's for the rest of the world , when they think of new york , they think of manhattan . just like they thought of the world trade center , now they think of times square and other landmarks around the city . i do n't want to give anybody ideas . but there are so many landmarks which are known all over the world.so this is essential . i do n't know why the president took this money out in the first place . it 's needed . it 's absolutely essential . and there is a bipartisan effort in new york to restore that funding .charlie , you agree ?

why no credit cards ? you can afford to pay them ?
 lisa , lis wiehl , rather , in seattle . people are asking , they ask me this all the time , i 'm sure everyone hears it , and it 's the old axiom , if gary condit had nothing do with this disappearance , forget everything else he may have had with other women and all that , why did n't he come forward ? what does he have to lose if he did n't have anything to do with this ? wiehl : and maybe if he had come forward sooner that would have been an easy answer but now with all of this other stuff coming out , and him sort of imploding , you know , running out and throwing out watch cases , for example , in the middle of the night , it is really hard for him to do that.i do think , though , the police are showing signs of moving on . i mean now they are finally going to go and you know , look up those registered sexual offenders that are in those very neighborhoods . and maybe look into those other cases of missing women in those neighborhoods . my question -- why have n't they done that before ? why have n't they been , you know , stalking the neighbors , basically , to get information ? barbara olson , does this give cause -- the reason people are thinking that condit is involved is because he is n't helping their thinking any , right ?
 so you would be opposed to a gay marriage ?
 now , if he turns 21 and she 's 31 , and she 's out of jail , they could get married .

 we 're with mary mapes , the book '' truth and duty , the press , the president and the privilege of power . '' cbs news gave us this statement today . '' mary mapes ' actions damaged cbs news as an organizational and brought pain to many colleagues with whom she worked . her disregard for journalistic standards -- and for her colleagues -- comes through loud and clear in her interviews and in the book that attempts to rewrite the history of this complex and sad affair.as always , revisionist history must be tested against the facts . not only are those facts contained in the extensive media coverage that took place at the time , but also in the 200-plus-page report of the independent panel which investigated the matter for more than three months.we believe those facts speak for themselves . the idea that a news organization would not need to authenticate such important source material is only one of the troubling and erroneous statement in her account .

 when you sit with your boy , lindy , and you talk to him and sing to him , do you feel you are getting through ? michaelis : he makes eye contact . it makes us feel that he sees us , and he is not able to respond . we have heard about a lot of people that have been kind of in a locked place , where they are not able to respond , but they heard everything that went on in the room . and we are not taking any chances . we tell him how much we love him . we read scripture to him , we sing to him . i even had one day where i felt the lord said , '' go tell ryan something funny , '' and i told everybody , '' go tell him something funny .

 barbara , the pr people tonight said do n't listen to lawyers , listen to pr people in something like this . and even though no one wants to compare this to bill clinton , that is how he came out and sort of did a statement . and so i would assume that gary condit , in the first question connie chung gives him , is going to try to lay the groundwork , his own statement to avoid other statements.but there is one question that i do n't think gary condit can answer , and that i think is why we all aimed at gary condit , besides the fact that he has a relationship . gary condit , did you ask chandra levy to leave her id at home when she was with you ? and why ? because that is yet another piece of evidence why we have looked at gary condit . we are told she left the apartment with nothing but her keys .that 's a fair point , is n't it ? a good question .

 all right , jeff greenfield is with us in new york , he is standing by and we 'll get his comments immediately following . and then we 'll check in with norm ornstein , and bob woodward , and roger cossack . we 'll come back.we 'll also talk with senators john warner on the right and john kerry on the left.and as we approach 6:30 pacific time , 9:30 eastern time , we 're about to hear from governor george w. bush of texas , declared by the secretary of state of florida the certified winner in that state tonight.here is governor bush.the last 19 days have been extraordinary ones . as our nation watched , we were all reminded on a daily basis of the importance of each and every vote . we were reminded of the strength of our democracy , that while our system is not always perfect , it is fundamentally strong and far better than any other alternative.the election was close , but tonight , after a count , a recount and yet another manual recount , secretary cheney and i are honored and humbled to have won the state of florida , which gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.we will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to serve as america 's next president and vice president.during the past year and a half of the presidential campaign , i 've had the privilege of traveling america and meeting so many of my fellow americans : the teachers who mold our future , the volunteers who take time to help neighbors in need , the police and firemen who risk their lives to protect ours , the workers who keep our economy strong and growing.these experiences have confirmed that ours is a strong and vibrant nation , full of people whose hearts are bigger than even our most bountiful harvest.as our country ends its thanksgiving weekend , we have so much to be thankful for , beginning with the fundamental freedoms that are the birthright of every america : life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness.and with our freedom comes responsibility , for all of us . once our elections are behind us , once our disagreements are expressed , we have a responsibility to honor our constitution and laws , and come together to do the people 's business.two hundred years ago , after a difficult election , president thomas jefferson reminded his fellow citizens that every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.vice president gore and i had our differences of opinion in this election , and so did the many candidates who ran for the united states congress . but there is broad agreement on some important principles.republicans and democrats agree we need to provide an excellent education for every child at every public school.democrats and republicans agree that our seniors deserve a secure retirement and a prescription drug coverage in medicare . already there is some bipartisan groundwork on efforts to reform social security and medicare . we have a duty to find common ground to reform these vital programs for the greatest generation and for future generations.republicans and democrats want a strong military to keep the peace and a foreign policy that reassures our friends and restrains our enemies.there is growing consensus in congress and america on the need to reduce taxes by reducing the marriage penalty and eliminating the death tax.and i will work with members of the congress from both parties to reduce tax rates for everyone who pays income taxes in america.progress on these issues will require a new tone in washington . the path to progress is consideration and fair-dealing . i 've worked with democrats and republicans in texas , and i will do so in washington . i will listen and i will respect different points of view , and , most of all , i will work to unite our great land.this has been a hard-fought election , a healthy contest for american democracy . but now that the votes are counted , it is time for the votes to count.the vice president 's lawyers have indicated he will challenge the certified election results . i respectfully ask him to reconsider.until florida 's votes were certified , the vice president was working to represent the interests of those who supported him . i did not agree with his call for additional recounts , but i respected his decision to fight until the votes were finally certified . now that they are certified , we enter a different phase . if the vice president chooses to go forward , he is filing a contest to the outcome of the election , and that is not the best route for america.all of us in this election fought for our views . now we must live up to our principles . we must show our commitment to the common good , which is bigger than any person or any party . we can not change yesterday , but we share a responsibility for tomorrow . time runs short , and we have a lot of work to do . so tonight i 'm naming secretary dick cheney to chair our transition effort , and secretary andy card to serve as my chief of staff.i 've asked secretary cheney to work with president clinton 's administration to open a transition office in washington . and we look forward to a constructive working relationship throughout this transition.the end of an election is the beginning of a new day . together we can make this a positive day of hope and opportunity for all of us who are blessed to be americans.thank you very much , and god bless america .ok , jeff greenfield , our senior analyst , it began with like a campaign speech , a little conciliatory and then forward ahead , transition and everything . what did you make of it , jeff ?
 apex , north carolina -- i 'm sorry . go ahead .

''you 're always -- you ai n't so little anymore . you were once little stevie wonder , right ?

'' all the hokum that they were saying about , we do n't consider him a suspect , is hokum . the police , knowing that i was representing him , made end runs around me to directly talk to scott without me there . i knew that the rules of engagement had changed , and this was going to be a street fight . the police approached this entire case with the attitude of a theory to begin with .

 i 'm going to take a quick break . we 'll come right back with senator tom daschle , and i 'll ask him about the terrorism alert and other things , and we 'll pause for this word and be right back with the majority leader . do n't go away .we 're back with the majority leader of the united states senate , senator tom daschle of south dakota . what do you make of the non-specific terrorism alerts ? we 've had two now .
 we did local benefits in miami .
 fox legal , they own harpercollins , and judith regan works for them .
 when they broke up it was -- remember how big a story that was ?
 all right , hang with us for a minute , karen . i got just one or two things to ask , but i want to ask senator bob kerrey , the former democrat of nebraska , member of the national commission on terrorist attacks , decorated veteran of the vietnam war -- how do you assess tonight ? and you 're always honest in your assessment . you 're usually not political . you give us the straight shot . what do you think ? and i honestly and sincerely believe that president bush wants a victory in iraq , but i only -- i believe sincerely that only john kerry can deliver it . it is going to take a considerable amount of diplomacy . it is going to take a considerable amount of effort to persuade the american people that we have to sustain this course . either way this election goes , it 's going to be difficult for either one of these men to keep the american people on the side of keeping our forces in iraq . and i believe john kerry can get that done . i believe his approach to terrorism is solid.but most importantly of all , i believe he understands that the forces of globalism are tearing this country apart . the president has an economic plan that he put in place that is n't working . it 's opened up record deficits . we have record trade -- current account deficits with trade . we 're shipping our wealth overseas every single day . at least president kerry -- senator kerry comes in and has a proposal to increase the number of health insurance -- and the president says it 's a big government takeover . he likes government when it comes to fighting the war on terrorism , and indeed , in the current job numbers , it shows manufacturing jobs going down , service jobs going down and government jobs going up . so for all his opposition to the government , the only good news in the latest job report came from increased number employment working for the government.so i think that senator kerry 's recognizing significant domestic problems that are going on in the country today , and i think the country got a good delineation of the differences from two good men , two capable men who have a different vision for where they want to take the country .marc racicot , do you believe that iraq will be the central issue november 2 ?
 ... said -- a highly decorated marine with contacts at the pentagon said pull out , i mean you have to at least say -- take a step back and say this guy is not , you know , speaking out on the edges .
 sure .
 it is , is n't it ?
 and your mother ?

 david , they 're telling -- i 'll come back to you . they 're telling me to go to break . we 'll come right back .as we come back , we 're expecting the attorney general of massachusetts -- that is not her -- to address the crowd shortly . let 's go back to david gergen for his analysis , as i interrupted him . and as soon as the attorney general of massachusetts gets up to speak , we 'll go right to her . david ?
 well , he is going to have a beautiful resting place and i know you guys are heading there.thanks , leonard .
 floyd , that 's the other aspect of it , is n't it ?

 thanks , arwa . arwa damon , our cnn correspondent , who of course staying atop this historic story which will really be complete august 31st . we 're joined now by representative peter king , republican congressman from new york . he 's opposed to the islamic center and mosque at ground zero . and keith ellison , democrat , from minnesota . he 's the first muslim elected to congress and he supports the islamic center and mosque.congressman king , if -- if it 's not a legal question , why ca n't they build it ? the fact is that there 's so many people were murdered that day on september 11th . and to have this 13-story , $ 100 million edifice constructed , barely 500 feet from ground zero is causing tremendous pain certainly to many of my constituents who lost their friends and neighbors that day.and to me , the fact is whether or not -- obviously , 99 percent of muslim-americans are outstanding americans . the fact is that this attack was carried out by an islamic force . and to have that mosque that close to ground zero i think is just -- it puts salt into wounds.i think governor paterson is entirely right . i 've had discussions with governor paterson . if he can make another site available through state property or a land swap which would satisfy all these -- the muslim community ; at the same time , satisfy the legitimate needs of family members who feel very offended by this or very struck by it . i think that is the route to go . i think that muslim officials , including the developer , should find a way to sit down with the governor .congressman ellison , it 's legally ok , but how about congressman king 's point that there 's a sensitive question here ?

 you deserve it .
 did you go to rehab ?
 oh you do ?
 really ?
 i 'll get it home to them tonight and we 'll talk more about it.you spoke with us earlier this month , in fact right after it broke you were kind enough to come right on , on the mark foley thing . now that you 've had some time to think about it , any afterthoughts ? walsh : you know i told you that i was completely caught off guard , appalled . first i think you go through the angry because i had worked so closely with him on the adam walsh child protection and safety bill . he was there in the rose garden on july 27th , the 25th anniversary of adam 's abduction when that bill was signed by president bush.and the most ironic part of this is that although they say these e-mails were two years ago , one of the components of that bill , all sex offender registries , all 50 states have uniform sex offender registry , mandatory collection of dna of convicted sex offenders and making solicitation of minors over the internet a federal crime . how ironic would that be that he was one of the writers of that bill and could have been prosecuted if he was continuing that behavior ? but it just proved one thing to me , as mad and angry as i was that the compulsion to search out minors and adolescents must be so strong that a congressman or whoever , a priest , you know , would risk their career to do this .do you put a 16-year-old in the same category you do an 8- year-old ?
 not unconscious ?

 you like him .
 is that your favorite ?
 straight out , just a straight no . do you keep hearing rumors about him and his whereabouts , by the way ? amanpour : yes . i mean the same as you do , and all sorts of different sources have different ideas and information about what might be the reality . but to be very honest , we do n't know . we do n't know .all right , christiane amanpour stays with us she 'll be with us as the panel assembles . we are going to talk about the proposals about , from the president about military tribunals for people who are apprehended and charged with crimes , people who are not citizens of the united states . secretary of -- rather the attorney general had something to say about that today , saying that they do n't -- people who are critics do n't trust their government . we 'll have a spirited debate , and we 'll get christiane amanpour 's views as well , from across the atlantic.this is larry king live , we will be right back . we 'll meet the panel . do n't go away .there 's continuing controversy in the united states over the president 's proposal about military tribunals . to discuss that christiane amanpour remains with us in kabul , afghanistan ; in washington is congressman james sensenbrenner , he is republican of wisconsin and chair of the house judiciary committee ; in new york it 's nancy grace , former prosecutor and anchor of '' trial heat '' on court tv ; in washington it 's julian epstein , the former chief minority counsel of the house judiciary committee ; and in new york is ron kuby , criminal defense attorney who 's been active , by the way , in defending people caught up in the muslim conspiracy trials , after the 1993 world trade center bombing . and he was on court tv 's documentary last night , called '' the system : osama bin laden on trial . '' just a quick update , the president defends these actions , as saying the enemy is declared war on us , and we must not let foreign enemies use forums of liberty , to destroy liberty . presidential council alberto gonzales writing in '' the new york times , '' says the order covers only foreign enemy war criminals . '' new york times '' columnist anthony lewis says the bush order covers all non-citizens , and there are about 20 million in the united states . and it 's not directed only at master minds , or those who participate in the act of terrorism.congressman sensenbrenner , where do you stand ?and that decision would be made by the president himself ? sensenbrenner : that 's correct . and i think the president sent a message by signing the executive order , himself , rather than having the attorney general announce it .and julian epstein what 's the rub to you ?

 was it after '' godfather '' ? pacino : yes , after the big movie started coming out . it started early in the theater , too . it was escalating . and i got the best advice i could ever get from anyone , lee strasbourg . the great lee strasbourg said to me , '' darling , you simply have to adjust . '' about fame .all right . al is currently starring on broadway --

'' they 're all next on larry king live.it 's a great pleasure to welcome to larry king live an old friend , senator trent lott , the minority leader of the united states senate -- has n't been with us since september 11.so we will begin with where were you that day ? and what 's your assessment since , generally ? i went to my window in the capitol , because my office is there on the west front of the capitol , and looked off to the south , and i could see the very dark plume of smoke from the pentagon . and i said , '' you know , i do n't like the looks of this , let 's evacuate the building . '' made one call to tom daschle , and we were then moved to the police headquarters and on from there.it 's been a very interesting experience , larry , one filled with grief and sadness and pride , unity and a lot of work . here in the congress we have cooperated more on a bipartisan , nonpartisan basis than i 've ever seen it in my 29 years as a member of congress . it 's getting more difficult , but we still have a reservoir of desire to do what 's necessary to help the president carry out this effort to stop terrorism here in america , but also to , you know , get access to bin laden and al qaeda .but at the same time , we 're wary of what 's going on . would you bring us up to date on the hart building ?
 if she chose to be nude , that would be fine with you and ...
 west monroe , louisiana . last call . hello .

'' and again , that has been authenticated by some people and not authenticated by others , regarding that e-mail . what does it say to you , robert , that statement ? sounds sincere to me .

 harold , is that interest still true in great britain , at the level it 's been ? brooks-baker : well , i think that things change constantly . but certainly , the queen , who is head of the commonwealth and is head of state in 16 countries of those 54 countries , remains one of the most important heads of state in the world today . she has far more power than most people realize , but she uses it in a very judicious way . no question that there are not many other people in the world who have the importance that she has , and that 's why there is this emphasis on the close members of her family.it certainly is unfair , but life is n't fair . as the americans say , good guys do n't win ballgames . and i think that prince harry needs to be given a full-time job as soon as he finishes his studies and be prepared for the chance that he one day might be king , and not just sit and wait , as poor princess margaret has and as many other members of royal families around the world have , with absolutely nothing of importance to do , as far as politics is concerned .philadelphia , hello .

 john king , as a reporter , reportorially , what does ted kennedy mean ?well , larry , as paul said , he has been a giant in washington , a giant in the democratic party , a giant in the bush administration improving in a time when where we are polarized in washington and not much gets done on big things , that it 's not a crime and it 's not a shame and it 's not abandoning your principles and beliefs to reach across the aisle and work with a guy who you might disagree with most of the time , but if the issue is big enough , let 's see what we can agree on and get things done . that is my perspective on senator kennedy as a reporter . i can tell you , larry , as a kid who grew up in dorchester , massachusetts , in an irish catholic neighborhood , you learned mom , dad , milk , maybe no , and then the kennedys . you know , the kennedys were part of your life from a very young child . and he has had a huge impact on the state of massachusetts , obviously . and the thing that strikes you at a time like this is he is in the hospital and unable to speak for himself publicly at the moment , although he is making phone calls to people . and we should be very careful.he is a fighter , and by all accounts , he says he wants to try to fight at this very difficult time . remember all the tragedies in this family . his two brothers gunned down . remember jfk jr. , his nephew , died in the tragic plane crash . in all of the moments of tragedy and trial in the kennedy family , it has almost always been ted kennedy who pulled them together , who delivered the eulogies , who was the glue in the family.now it is him who is in a moment of crisis . so it is a remarkable generational reminder , if you will , of the brothers kennedy , the famous political brothers kennedy . we never saw one of them get so old .well put . now candy crowley , he 's the patriarch of the whole family , is n't he ?
 we going to cure the cold , dr. arnot ? arnot : well , i would suspect that in the next 10 years we 're getting a little closer , but it 's amazing to think of the number of diseases that we have been able to cure , and we have not been able to cure the common cold yet . i do think , though , that in terms of cold prevention , in terms of the right kind of exercise program , diet , and what i would do when i start to get a cold is lots of zinc lozenges , echinacea , vitamin c -- maybe not scientifically proven , but i swear my colds go away before they start .dr. johnson , do you think we 're going to cure it next 10 years ?

 thanks , bill.let 's check in now with congressman dana rohrabacher who has just got into our studios . i believe he 's in irvine , california . congressman , i must tell you that so far the consensus has not been very positive . what 's your read ? first of all he 's playing these word games about massive deportation again , which no one is advocating and does not do anything to further an honest debate . and then he talks about amnesty in a way and with a definition that nobody in the world agrees with.i mean the fact is if you normalize someone 's legal status who is in this country , meaning if they are here illegally and you make them here legally that is an amnesty.now whatever they call it , it is a normalization that will create a huge magnet to draw more people into our country . and , anybody who 's -- if he 's bolstering the border he 's just negated that by increasing the magnet by normalizing the status of illegals in this country.so , i 'm very disappointed in the president 's speech , although i give him credit for a couple steps forward but the benefits of those steps are overwhelmed by the negative result of normalizing someone 's legal status who is here illegally .lou dobbs , the anchor of cnn 's '' lou dobbs tonight , '' are you surprised to learn , i know you 've been focusing in a lot of places , that this entire panel , liberal , conservative , up , down , all of them seems thus far to be disappointed in this speech ? are you ?

'' wesley snipes in a little while . sad night . we , like everyone , were very sad to learn of elizabeth edwards ' death today . we send our sincere condolences to her family . she died at her home in chapel hill just a day after announcing on her facebook page that further treatment for cancer would be unproductive.joining us with the latest from north carolina is amanda lamb with wral tv in raleigh . what do we know about her passing ? do we have an official cause of death and everything established , amanda ?
 nobody is tuning in now for redford and newman .

'' and suddenly , the conversation came to a stop in the audience , and the door opened , and in walked this blonde venus in a white satin white gown that was just fabulous . it hugged all her curves.and she shimmered over to a group of gentlemen who were standing in the corner talking about walt whitman , the poet . and marilyn , anxious to get into the conversation , she heard whitman and she said , '' oh , i just love his chocolates . '' well , jack and i were standing very close by , and the first one ...did you ...

'' larry , we also got a question on the blog tonight . it comes in from jennifer . she 's asked : '' what kind of follow-up is available to the contestants from the trainers and the producers of the program ? ''oh , well ?
 well she asked how could they afford that .

 he 's the real culprit here , right ?
 great day .
 how big is the tour ?
 how do you react when your father was quoted as saying bill clinton should have come forward and said everything early -- about whatever was wrong with -- what he was going through ?
 and you register -- do you register republicans , too ?
 should -- fairly enough , should morality be an issue ?
 because they 're little and they 're brown and they 're nondescript .
 we 'll spend a few more moments with president bill clinton right after this .we 're back on the six month anniversary of the clinton global initiative which has been a roaring success and they 're having another big meeting today and have had one in new york.we 're talking with the former president . a couple of other items and a couple of items on the global initiative and get him on with his very busy day . is it a civil war in iraq ? clinton : oh , i do n't know that you can call it that yet because they 're all still i think somewhat jockeying for position . what i hope will happen is that all those people who voted in huge numbers , they voted they thought to constitute a government which would function , hold the country together , be able to keep peace and guarantee each of their groups a reasonable share of the country 's oil and other wealth.that 's what i still hope can happen and if it does n't happen in addition to civil war you may have the sunni section becoming a launching pad for terrorism in the region . that did occur with the al qaeda jordan group , mr. zarqawi 's group when they blew up those hotels in jordan recently.so , i hope it 's not a civil war . i do n't think we 're there yet but i think the real question is whether the political process which has been pretty drawn out since that election , remember they had a huge turnout in the election of all the groups . they all voted wanting to influence a civil government.so , i still think the vast majority of people would prefer non- violence , do n't want a civil war but i think that there 's not a great deal of time to put this kind of government together.and , as long as they 've got a coherent effort , if they 're working together , then the united states can help them . we can draw down our troop presence , reconstitute it , put in safer areas and give them a few more months to try to make this work.i worry if the whole thing is just allowed to disintegrate . then we could have it not only terrible for the iraqis but also being a base of terrorist operations , something which it was not before the invasion . so , i 'm not giving up yet but it 's not pleasant . it 's tough .do you see an end game ? do you see an end game ?
 so , but everyone else is all right ?
 that 's the south african police ?
 the company has a statement . i want the lawyer to comment on it . here is what countrywide said -- we asked them for this , and they said , '' while we can not comment on pending litigation , we will say that during mr. zachary 's employment with countrywide , the company invested each of his claims and found no merit to his accusations . further , we can confirm mr. zachary 's termination was performance related and not related to any concerns he raised . countrywide has a firm policy against any such action . '' philip , what do you make of that ? philip hilder , attorney : absolutely untrue . those are comments , deceitful comments by the company , in the same manner in which they 've operated , quite frankly . we know that they have n't fully investigated , because if they did , they would be supporting what we have to say .in any way , mark , was the consumer partially possible ?

 six of one , half a dozen .
 did they catch you right there ?
 and you 're able to accept this ?

 why -- you 've studied people for a long time , and that 's part of this initiative here that you 're looking into . we want to discuss various facets of it . why do we have so much of that ? it seems more -- maybe i 'm wrong -- more of that in the world today .

 so the music was honest ?
 how close did you come to sharks ?
 john king , besides the fact that the plot was thwarted today , and that 's good news , any other good news in this , do you think ?well , good news in the sense , larry , one of the constant debates is the united states , any government around the world , changes its tactics and then the terrorists adjust . we have seen it since 9/11 here in this country . we are watching it every day as we are watching the insurgency in iraq . we 're watching it to a degree as we watch israel fight hezbollah now . every group changes tactics . you learn the lessons of the last war and you plan your next offensive or your next strategy . so if there 's good news in this , it 's that we know that they can carry bottles like this and little thing like this and get an electronic device and make a bomb . the bad news in that is , in the short term at least , you 're going to have people grumpy in the lines going through . people saying why ca n't i bring this aboard an airplane , but if you talk to intelligence officials they say , ok , now they know that we know this and they 'll try to learn another way .peter bergen , will we have a hero her , is there a hero , do you think ?
 you 've never seen him ?
 did you try it ?i tried it , and it had a very -- i had a bad reaction . that was the day we were in the meeting and i could n't focus . i started crying in the middle of a meeting . and , you know , that was my lucky break .you had an adverse reaction . do you take topamax ?

'' naturally , how could they convict ? they 're not a trial of fact . '' that the conviction occurred in a trial , before a jury of mr. marsh 's peers . our medical personnel were asked to give their professional trained opinions on the likely cause of death . after painstaking and sober examination of all evidence using the best knowledge and techniques available at the time , these physicians formulated the opinions and testimony recorded at trial , based on the facts . we believe the physicians ' testimony at trial were well supported by the medical evidence , and that the jury 's decision speaks for itself . '' why do you think you were convicted ?

 we 're with martin luther king iii , the son of the late dr. martin luther king jr. , human and civil rights leader , and founder of realizing the dream incorporated . has the dream been accomplished ?an aspect of the dream with the election of president- elect obama achieved . but i would say we 've got a long way to go before we really achieve the dream . my dad talked about triple evils of poverty , racism and militarism . obviously , in relationship to race , a monumental step has been made with the election of the first black president . but poverty and militarism , they are at epidemic levels . poverty at epidemic levels , militarism , we just yet do n't know how to learn to live together without destroying personal property .what makes him so special ?him ?barack obama .oh , my goodness . you name it . number one , he 's visionary . he has been able to galvanize and capture the imagination of young people and americans broadly . that 's , i think , probably one of his greatest assets . i mean , obviously , he 's one of the most intelligent men that we 've seen , has the potential to be our greatest president yet .that potential is there ?absolutely . no question about it .how do you explain the tremendous public affection for him ? widespread , worldwide ?well , i just think that he rose to the occasion for such a time as this . and i would have to say that we have been , for eight years , living in a polarized environment and consumed with one thing , terrorism and militarism . president-elect obama came with a totally different vision and appealed to the best of americans . americans are wonderful people . when the tsunami occurred around the world , americans rolled up their sleeves and helped . when katrina occurred , america helped . they just have to know and be given a little guidance as to what to do.today , in fact , probably several million americans were engaged in a service . the goal , though , is to be engaged not just on the king holiday , but throughout the year .you were with obama today ?yes .what were you doing ?we were actually painting a home for young men and young women who initially were homeless . but the kids were there involved also . and to see the president come in , president-elect now , tomorrow president , come in just to watch them , i mean , was just amazing , you know . and , of course , those who were outside waiting . people waited for a long period of time . when the president-elect left , there probably were three times as many people there in about a half an hour . l .what goes through you when you see your father speaking at the lincoln memorial , which you must have seen hundreds of times ?what goes through me is the hope and aspiration of a vision for our nation and world that we can achieve within our lifetime . it 's not there yet . some aspects -- as i said , a huge aspect in relationship to this election occurred around race . but until we fulfill poverty and address militarism -- and there 's some other issues that relate , such as education . i mean , something is wrong with our nation when we allow young black and young hispanic and latino children to drop out of school at the age of third , fourth , fifth grade . that 's not right . that 's unacceptable . but we 're going to -- we now have an opportunity to change that entire paradigm .where will you be tomorrow ?i 'll be right here with everybody else watching this inaugural and hopefully participating . but i must say , on january 21st , the president-elect has challenged us . and we all have to got to roll up our sleeves , as you already have and often do , get to work .thank you , martin .thank you so much .martin luther king jr. when we come back , the civil rights movement and america 's first black president . did leaders ever think they 'd see that day ? there were two men president right around -- in fact , one was there when martin luther king was shot . we 'll meet two of them when we come back .two men of history reflect on tomorrow . reverend jesse jackson , president of the rainbow push coalition , civil rights activist , worked with dr. king , was with dr. king when he was shot at that motel in memphis . and reverend ralph abernathy iii , son of reverend ralph abernathy jr. he was one of martin luther king 's closest friends . his father was with martin luther king , and martin luther king died in his father 's arms . what 's this night like for you , jesse ?

 rosie and madonna ...
 i do n't know . i do n't know whether that is 100 percent of the vote in gary or whether this 28 percent is 100 percent from gary , if you get the distinction . and that is a significant question because gary is the most african american city in the district . and again , as you get more out here , this area , you have the mayor on right now , he can describe it to you a lot better than i can , but this is literally a stone 's throw from illinois and not too far from chicago . this is more chicago suburbs . this here is a city into itself gary , indiana , where you have a more significant african american population . then down here , you 're suburban along the state line , down here tends to get much more rural , fewer population in this part of the counties . you see senator clinton did very well in the surrounding , more rural , areas . it is in the urban areas and the chicago suburb areas -- and i 'm going to show you by taking this off -- i just want to bring you over here to illinois just to show you the illinois primary results.this is barack obama 's home . but he did , in these surrounding areas , the cook county suburbs just around there , obama got 63 percent of the vote there . john edwards was still on the ballot at that moment . barack obama did extraordinarily well in the city of chicago , urban chicago and in the suburbs just around it . the question is how much of that carried over into neighboring indiana ?

 what happened to the other guy in the car ?
 welcome back to this special edition of larry king live . with our panel of reed dickens , ron reagan , lanny davis and bev smith . we 'll get back with them in a moment.right now let 's get another look at the board and john king . john , by the way , do you have a name for that board ?larry --i 'm not kidding .it 's a --it deserves a name .it 's officially the cnn multi-touch . that is what we call it . it comes from the manufacturer . it 's called a multi-touch . around the shop here , some people call it the magic wall . some people call it the magic board . most of the time , when i 'm getting along with it , i call it wonderful and beautiful . when it defies me a little bit , we fight a little bit .in other words , you 're in love with this board ?let 's show them how it works .it 's amazing . let 's look quickly at what happened tonight , and then i want to look forward . amazing to see what happens ; barack obama wins the city of philadelphia by a huge margin , larry , 65-35 percent . normally , if you 're a democrat in the state of pennsylvania , that 's what you want , because that carries you when you move out to other places.but then look what happened . he won in philadelphia . he won in some not-so-populated counties down here . but then wow , hillary clinton just swept out blue-collar corridor here , blue-collar corridor here , rural voters out in the middle , and out here . hillary clinton just trounced him across , in some places , by 80-20 , 65-35. an impressive demographic and geographic sweep by senator clinton across this state , larry.what does that all mean ? you zoom out to the map here . you see the contests still to come . well , kentucky , west virginia and indiana are in this neighborhood . that will be a big fight ahead . you 've been talking a little bit about north carolina tonight . oregon , the next big state that matters out there.but here 's what heart matters the most . this is what the conversation is about in the democratic party right now . senator clinton makes up some ground tonight in the delegate chase . she 's still behind barack obama . the green line is where we are tonight . here 's what 's left out there to allocate . a little under 500 delegates remaining and then 311 super delegates.let 's just say , larry -- this is a hypothetical . let 's say they roughly split the delegates the rest of the way . of the 490 , i 'm going to give here -- let 's see , that 's around -- that 's a little more than half . let 's give a little more than half to senator clinton . it 's a hypothetical . let 's give the rest down here to senator obama.well , then she 's still behind obama at the end , if they split them roughly in half the rest of the way out . so what happens ? these 300 super delegates decide who the democratic party 's nominee is . how will they make their calculation ? will they make it on who has the most pledged delegates ? under this scenario , obama does narrowly.will they make under who has the lead in the popular vote ? under this scenario , obama probably would just narrowly . or will they make it about who 's electable ? that 's up to them . that 's the call they make . but if they did , let 's say senator clinton got this many . she gets close to the finish line . the big calculation is that obama needs a smaller number , larry . if he got 123 of them , he would cross the finish line there.so these super delegates -- i 'm going to take them away and put them back in their home in the undecided for now . these are the people who are going to decide your democratic nominee , unless something dramatic and something completely out of line with what we have seen happen so far happens in the future . even if they split going forward , your super delegates in the end make the decision .very well said . thanks , john . get some rest .thank you .john king , terrific reporting . ron reagan , are super delegates democratic ?
 so you win either way in that one ?
 did you ever see -- did he like guns ? did he talk about killing people ?

 how about costume -- costume changes ? dion : well , about costumes -- yes , i think people like to see artists change in different outfits . again , it 's a -- you have to be careful with that . people want you to change . they want to see outfits . and if you change too much , they say it 's too much . and if you change too little , they say it 's not enough . so you have to change just enough . you ca n't please everybody . but i have a wonderful stylist , annie horth , that i 'm going to be working with again and who will make sure that we can please as many people as possible . but you know me with fashion . i enjoy that very , very much . so i will try to change , not too little and not too much.hopefully i 'll have my shape again . but i 'm not very worried about that . first thing first , the health of the children . and i 'm sure annie will find the perfect dress for the perfect size for the moment that i will be in .she 's one of the great performers in the world . celine dion . returning to vegas in march of next year on a three-year contracted run . we 'll be back with celine after this .we 're back with celine dion . i imagine vegas is much easier than that tour you did .

 ok. it has a chief of police . i spoke with him today , and then they sent me a long letter here , from the city of hermosa to larry king , care of me here in hollywood , and we will show you portions of what they said right now . let me read this to you , so we get this . '' it should be noted , '' this is what they say : '' that his blood alcohol level was tested , and registered 0.08/0.09 , which is the threshold of making the determination of whether someone is under the influence or not . '' and they also said , i want to get this all in full here : '' there was no bicoastal conspiracy of police and prosecutors out to get roger clinton , as his attorney would have you believe . the vehicle roger clinton was driving was stopped because of an erratic driving pattern , typical of someone driving under the influence . the officer who made the traffic stop was acting in the due diligence of his job . he did a professional diu investigation , and made the determination that roger clinton was diu . '' then they also add : '' roger clinton was transported to the station where he completed a breathalyzer test of his alcohol blood content which showed that , in fact , he had been driving while under the influence of alcohol . this was handled as any other diu case . however , because roger clinton is the brother of the former president , he was housed separately from all other prisoners in his own cell for his safety and protection .

 let 's watch ryan 's reaction to the wedding details . watch .
 james frey 's publisher released a statement today after the oprah show was broadcast . here 's what it said . '' the controversy over james frey 's '' a million little pieces '' has caused serious concern at doubleday and anchor books . recent interpretations of our previous statement notwithstanding , it is not the policy ore stance of this company that it does n't matter whether a book is sold as non-fiction or is true.a non-fiction book should adhere to the facts as the author knows them . it is , however , doubleday and anchor 's policy to stand with our authors when accusations are initially leveled against their work and we continue to believe this is right and proper.a publisher 's relationship with an author is based to an extent on trust . mr. frey 's repeated representations of the book 's accuracy throughout publication and promotion assured us that everything in it was true to his recollections.when the smoking gun report appeared , our first response , given that we were still learning the facts of the matter , was to support our author . since then we have questioned him about the allegations and have sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished.we bear a responsibility for which we apologize and apologize to the reading public for any unintentional confusion surrounding the publication of '' a million little pieces . '' we are immediately taking the following actions . we 're issuing a publisher 's note to be included in all future printings of the book . james frey is writing an author 's note that will appear in all future printings of the book . the jacket for all future editions will carry the line '' with new notes from the publisher and from the author . '' and , although the demand for the book remains high we are not currently reprinting or fulfilling orders until we make the above changes . the publisher 's note and the author 's note will be posted prominently on the randomhouse.com web site.the publisher 's note and author 's note will promptly be sent to booksellers for inclusion in previously shipped copies of the book . an advertisement concerning these developments will appear in national and travel publications in the next few days . '' william bastone of the smoking gun does that cover it from the publisher 's standpoint ?
 it 's a comedy ?
 ann , what was your read tonight ?
 we 're back . in a new discovery channel documentary , astrophysicist stephen hawking said that communicating with aliens could be a threat to earth . hawking says it 's likely that alien life exists , and that a visit from extraterrestrials might be similar to columbus ' arrival in the americas . in other words , did n't turn out too well for native americans . joining us are dr. michio kaku , futurist , physicist , best-selling author of his newest book , '' physics of the impossible : a scientific exploration of the world of phasers , force fields , teleportation and time travel . '' seth shostak , senior astronomer of the seti institute . david brin , astronomer and futurist , and of course our friend , the well- known actor dan aykroyd who believes that alien life exists.we wanted to hear directly from the renowned british scientists , former guest on this program , author stephen hawking about his controversial claims.so i sent him some questions . here are his answers .do you think there will ever be direct contact between the inhabitants of earth and alien life ?it 's nice to see you again , larry . after 10 years . i think we may find primitive life , but it 's unlikely there are intelligent aliens within 100 light years , or we would have detected their radio signals .if contact does occur , do you think it will be initiated by us or by them ?they are likely to be more advanced than us . so they will contact us first .you 're warning that it may be too risky to try to contact space aliens has stirred a lot of debate . do you care to react to some of the criticism those who say the search for extraterrestrial life is central to central to space exploration ?i think we should look out for primitive life . if advanced life exists , they 'll contact us . aliens have n't contacted us so far , except maybe in the state of arizona .in your mind , what would an advanced alien look like ?they are bound to have a mouth opening because they will have to take in nutrition . and they will probably have legs because they will need to move around . and they 'll need eyes . but do n't expect them to look like marilyn monroe .should we ban messages into the universe for fear of attracting dangerous aliens ?it is too late . if they are looking , they will already have detected us .thanks for joining us . stephen hawking .goodbye , larry . i hope to see you this fall when my new book with leonard mlodinow , '' the grand design , '' is released . thank you .what do you make of his thinking ?
 it says you 're going to leave him because he would n't go on tour with you .

 president bush told us last night that he 's very appreciative that you are non-critical of his son . why are you non- critical of his son ? clinton : well , i think he appreciates the way i disagree with him , too . i made up my mind when i left the white house , you know ? and they 've been pretty tough on me , the republicans had . and i just kept on working with them . and i made up my mind when i left the white house that i was going to figure president bush out as a person . i always thought he was a very formidable political talent . i told all of our crowd in 2000 , when i saw him give his first speech , that he was capable of winning , that he was an extraordinary talent.and he 'd never been particularly friendly to me , and i did n't blame him . i defeated his father , and i did n't think he should like me . you know , it did n't bother me a bit . but i just kind of kept working at it . and then he was so nice to me , and to hillary , and to our families when we had the portrait unveiling .i 'll never forget that .

 tonight , exclusive . all nine democratic women of the united states senate . could one of them become the first female president ? how do they think bush is doing ? and how would they do it differently ? together for the hour next on larry king live.thanks for joining us . earlier today here in washington , the nine democratic women of the united states senate issued a challenge to the republican leadership . they unveiled what they call a checklist for change . nine important issues they say the senate can and should take specific action on right now.all nine of these honorable gentlewomen are with us tonight . they are senator barbara boxer of california , senator maria cantwell of washington , senator hillary rodham clinton of new york , senator dianne feinstein of california , senator mary landrieu of louisiana , senator blanche lincoln of arkansas , senator barbara mikulski of maryland , senator patty murray of washington , and senator debbie stabenow of michigan.they 're all with us . they issued this call today . and we 'll get to al these issues in a while . but let 's discuss first the most foremost issue , the two things going on in the senate right now . we have the kerry and the levin battle over iraq . where are you on this , senator feinstein ?senator stabenow , you want dates certain ? i think if you ask each of us , we have our own views on exactly how , but i think we represent the american people , the democrats do , and i think when you see the vote tomorrow , we do n't know what it will be , i predict a very strong vote for both of these alternatives and i think it will send a message that we are saying to the republican majority , it 's time to change the status quo in iraq .senator clinton , what about those pundits who are saying that you have a chance now , the democrats , to be united in something and if you all stood together in something you 'd have a better chance in november ? agreed ? i 'm very proud that the democratic party is once again listening to the concerns of the people and listening to the concerns of our men and women in uniform . we need a plan and we need a plan that will lead us to victory , both for our own benefit and for the benefit of the iraqis .senator mikulski , would it be better if you all were uniform on that plan ? we believe that the iraqi people have now chosen a government , they 're going to now form a government , and it 's time then for us to have a phased way of withdrawing . so what we 're united on is the goal . we 're debating two different methodologies . but at least we 're presenting ideas.where are the ideas of the republicans ? they say stay the course . there is no course . there is going to be a new strategy in iraq . no , he goes and he has a stunt . stunts and slogans are not a policy for bringing our troops back home and letting the iraqis act like the sovereign people they want to be . so that 's why we 're the democrats for change .senator murray ? when are we going to come home ? what is the mission now ? what is going to be the way we can declare success and bring it home ? how are we going to find a winnable solution there ? when is my husband or my wife or my son or my brother or my daughter finally going to come home and not get sent back again ? we 're asking those questions rather than the other side , which is merely saying , same thing that they did yesterday and two months ago and three years ago .and senator landrieu , that 's better than united saying out now ?and are n't lives the most important ?
 finally , how 's obama doing ?
 now , chad , you do n't take any medication ? does it work for you ?

 and chaia , when did you get interested in horses for like a living -- i mean , you 're involved with them all the time ?yes , always , since i was a little girl . i also read the walter farley '' black stallion '' series , which got me interested in arabians in particular . but i think all girls love horses in particular , and all animals .what is it about a girl and a horse , though ?i think , besides the obvious answer , which would be that the freedom and the strength , i mean the horse 's is the great equalizer , it 's one of the few situations in which women and men can compete on equal levels.beyond that , i think that women are generally considered more intuitive than men . i do n't think that 's true of all men , i think pony 's one of the few exceptions to that . but i do think that horses allow an outlet for that , because as you 're socialized , you 're taught the social mores of behaving and your persona , so to speak.with a horse , you can not play the persona , so to speak . you are who you are .tell me pony boy , about the horse ? what makes the horse different ? the horse is different from all creatures of the kingdom .

'' he was a candidate for his party 's nomination , and he 's coming to us direct from a rally for john kerry.in santa fe , new mexico is governor bill richardson , the democratic governor of new mexico , former ambassador to the u.n. and in washington , laura ingraham , an old friend , host of the nationally syndicated '' the laura ingraham show '' on talk radio network , best- selling author of '' shut up and sing : how elites from hollywood , politics and the u.n. are subverting america . '' since we have two senator grahams , they will allow me on this program to call them by their first name so they know who i 'm talking to , and i 'll figure out who 's getting a cell phone.lindsey , we 'll start with lindsey graham . lindsey , what do you make of the osama bin laden thing ?bob , you see any political effect of this one way or the other in the united states ?governor richardson , veteran of the international scene , what do you make of this , and the timing of it ? i was very proud by the statesman-like statement of both candidates . i think tonight we should do everything we can to not make this and not even speculate of what kind of effect this is going to have on the election.we should also think of the families that lost loved ones on september 11th . they probably suffered the most , seeing this killer on the screen basically goading us again .and , laura ingraham , what do you make of this kind of negotiation on the part of a terrorist ?

 but we still get down to the individual , do n't we ? and as mike said and we 've said , what does the individual do tomorrow with the threat ?
 makes sense . kevin , what was with dr. phil ? i think you spoke with him , right ? and he went to the hospital . what was that story ? frazier : well , dr. phil worked with britney 's family for about a year . he did go to the hospital on january 3rd , when she was taken to the hospital . and i think a little bit of it was that it got spun out of control , that dr. phil was trying to exploit britney also . and really , what was going on is that he had been involved with the parents for at least a year . he has a wealth of information on this subject . he really wanted to do a show about parents and people who have older children or siblings that are having some kind of mental issue or drug issue , and that you ca n't commit them or you ca n't reach them . the whole thing kind of spun out of control and he became the scape-goat in this situation .
 is this a typical spring occurrence ?
 boy . we 'll be back with more of dr. phil . '' the ultimate weight solution : the 7 keys to weight loss freedom '' is the book . it 's no . 1 on the '' new york times '' list . more calls after this .

 so , you know , because that -- i bet that 's the thing most people would think about , right ?
 does n't it bother you , kimberly , as a prosecutor -- i know you do n't have to prove motive .
and what did you feel ?
 you 're not assuming that all the women deserve to have their children taken away are you ?
 computers , no .

 polio was eliminated .
 let me ...
 a wife .
 he 's outside --
 that would be interesting .
 and that business is called what , giuliani and associates ?
 did mr. couey ever look at you ?
 and , fran , one of the question 's that 's always asked is the coordination . in the past , some investigations go very well . others you have questions about whether the left hand is talking to the right hand , whether the state is talking to the federal.do you have any questions tonight ? or have you seen anything in the last 24 hours that would make you say , maybe there 's a problem here ?
 ok. the doctors gave us a statement . we contacted the hospital , and here 's what they said . '' all physicians involved with this case used every possible means , treatment , and technology available at the time to treat this injured boy and try to save his life . we 're distressed to any suggestions to the contrary . it should also be noted that the doctors at children 's did not convict mr . marsh . '' naturally , how could they convict ? they 're not a trial of fact . '' that the conviction occurred in a trial , before a jury of mr. marsh 's peers . our medical personnel were asked to give their professional trained opinions on the likely cause of death . after painstaking and sober examination of all evidence using the best knowledge and techniques available at the time , these physicians formulated the opinions and testimony recorded at trial , based on the facts . we believe the physicians ' testimony at trial were well supported by the medical evidence , and that the jury 's decision speaks for itself . '' why do you think you were convicted ?
 ed ?
 we keep hearing , larry , about a failure to connect the dots . based on what you know , are we connecting the dots ? johnson : yes , we are . and i think that is an outrageous charge and really it 's not correct . i 've worked in intelligence now for 25 years . i still hold clearances . i still work both with intelligence analysts and military operators.and this information was getting its way through the system . the reality larry is the failure was n't on the intelligence side . the failure was at the airport . ten years ago , you would profiled this individual . and by profiling , i do n't mean you look at the race , ethnicity , size of his body . you look at the fact that he bought a ticket going one way with cash with no luggage and you 're going to detroit in december without a winter coat ? that immediately 10 years ago would have forced the airline to pull him aside and say , ok , what 's up and start looking at him and maybe suggest him to some very specific training with some trace detectors . that could have been done . it wasn't.so yes , it 's unfortunate that the information had n't become instantaneous . but what 's going to happen out of this -- if we go this route , the critics will say , oh , you did n't connect the dots , it is going to create from the analysts standpoint a reaction where everything is going to come to the top . you are going to have such a blizzard of information that nobody will be able to actually see the real threats from -- there are hundreds of bogus threats that come through every day.and it 's sometimes only after the fact -- when this guy was identified firmly as having said , you know , i 'm going to blow up a plane , then everyone started going through the files . if his father had gone to the embassy and said look , my son has got exploding underwear , he 's going to fly and try to blow up a brain at detroit , if the cia had that information yes , they should be excoriated . but i guarantee you , they did not have that kind of information .we are going to have you both back very soon . thank you tyler and larry , happy new year .
 there 's a martyrdom .... certain -- certain people -- there 's a martyrdom that -- i had an interview on the day he died when he said , '' the one last thing i want to ever be is a martyr . '' of course , that is what happened .he died young .
 all right , lars ?
 but you want to be a photographer ? herbert : i 'm not sure . i may be interested in going into journalism and photo journalism .how did you react to the trial ?

 i agree .

 let me get a break and we 'll be back with more . you 're watching larry king live . do n't go away .
 were you home , will ? and if so , how did they handle it ?
 well said . we 'll take a break and come back . security was breached in two locations today . we 'll ask our panel about that . we 'll include more phone calls as well.this is larry king live . do n't go away .
 what 's he going to do ?
 we 're going to take a break , come back and include your phone calls . we 'll reintroduce our panel . do n't go away .let 's reintroduce the panel . in modesto is ted rowlands , reporter for ktvu-tv , ktvu-tv . he 's been covering this since the start . nancy grace , our anchor of '' trial heat '' on court tv , former prosecutor . chris pixley 's in atlanta , the famed defense attorney . here in los angeles , kimberly guilfoyle newsom . she 's the assistant district attorney from san francisco . and aissa wayne , the defense attorney who formerly , by the way , was the deputy city attorney for the city of los angeles . let 's include some calls . newcastle , california . hello .

 so the love you had , he was the teacher ?
 are they compatible ?
 eddie , you believe the system got it wrong in convicting them . why might you be optimistic that the system is now going to get it right ? vedder : well , i think that 's , you know , something that -- anybody who 's been involved in this case , we 've gotten an education that i do n't think we expected . and you certainly do n't know -- you see a lot of things that maybe are n't right with our justice system . and -- and making sure , you know , there 's some people that do n't want dna to be allowed in cases to exonerate people . you -- you see how long this process takes and how long the appeals process takes . we 're talking about -- you know , it 's very easy and very inexpensive to convict somebody initially , especially , you know , in a rural community , where there 's -- there 's no real funds to -- no resources to defend themselves against even a death penalty case . and then to see , you know , 16 , 17 years later , how -- how much funds , how many experts , how many , you know -- and people that will come along and support them and do activism to keep the case alive , because there 's a lot of these cases that are taking place that they have no voice.you know , we 're very fortunate to go -- joe berlinger made this initial documentary that spurred us all into being part of this . but you have to have faith in the justice system . it 's like having faith -- you know , it 's part of our country . it 's part of the fabric of our flag to believe in justice . and to believe in justice . but injustice does take place . and those are the things that you want to -- in this case , in particular , you know , the further it goes , and it 's very complex , but now we 're at a point where it seems very clear.again , we 're just asking that the arkansas supreme court just accepts this well-prepared case and argument and understands that they -- now is the time . they have a chance to make it right .natalie , have any of you , natalie , eddie or lorri , met with any of the victims ' families ?

 hamilton , you were going to say something ? peterson : yes , larry , many of the family members who i 've spoken with are just forever indebted to the a & e production , david gerber , delia fine ( ph ) did a masterful job and i say that having had the opportunity to hear the cockpit recordings and also some of the heartfelt and heart wrenching last minute phone calls by family members , not only from flight 93 but the other planes.a & e has managed to depict extremely accurately what unfolded to our knowledge on flight 93 and while many of us are under confidentiality agreements and can not be specific i will tell you that this is the movie that i will have my two young sons watch to give them a factual background as to what occurred on that plane .were any of the transcripts to your knowledge , ty , actual ? i mean were the sounds the actual sounds of the cockpit ?
 probably not , right ?
 it does n't bother you to look in mirror ?
 so it 's emotional for you ?

 oh , that 's nice .
 how about your dad ?
no children in that marriage ?
 what 's the question ?
 you got it . the first -- i 'm going .
 you had four children so you continued to be romantic with him , right ?
 it was n't the song you wrote , right ?
 how honest is a reality show ? i mean , how honest is the conversation as opposed to we know we 're being filmed ?
 now what happened to you , bo ? how did you pick up -- how did you find -- what happened ?
 so it was n't your mother . it was this place .
 do you know about format ? they do n't have three anchors for a half-hour show ?
 what do you think of his relationship with bill ?
 tucson , arizona , hello .
 are you against red-headed men basically ?
 used at conventions ?

 palm beach , florida , hello .

 bono , do you still run into people who say , '' yes , we got problems at home though ? '' this is their moment of need . this is a great royal people , the africans . they 're entrepreneurial people . they are being -- they 're being -- it 's a perfect storm has come against them of disease and poverty and i just think this is our moment to show what we 're about.you know , as i was saying earlier dangerous time we 're living in , this is the moment where we should show the world why we have amassed all this wealth and power that this is the moment for showing what our innovation and technology and pharmaceuticals can do . we can really do this and we can change the world for millions of people who are living in squalor but maybe more importantly in these dangerous times we can change the way those people see us and that might be critical if not more important .
 did you testify , brenda ?
 now you 're his alter ?
 ok , that 's good too . tampa , florida , hello .
 oh , you did .
 jean ...
 this is what sidey wrote '' this is history the likes of which i have never seen and nobody else has . as you know , george bush landed safely . then , in a few hours , he was off to spain with his grandson and then to rome to see the pope . and then he was coming back and going to latin america and he was going to play golf at augusta after the tournament was over . the life goes on . an amazing little vignette in this quite remarkable man , whatever your politics are . '' whew.what are we going to read , doro ?
 and was part of the reason for this the fact he would not allow you to interview the children ?
 what kind of license do you have now ?
 which you were addicted to both ? frey : yeah . nobody 's disputing that i was a drug addict or an alcoholic . nobody was disputing that i spent a significant period of time in a treatment center .
 do n't get mad at him ?
 how did a guy on a no-fly list almost escape ? why was he in pakistan for five months ? how does his neighbor feel about her children playing with a suspected terrorist 's kids ? she did n't have a clue.the international investigation continues with this warning .
 did n't they fear that you might have had lou gehrig 's disease ?
 he wanted to sell this to you ?
 is a skink like an alligator ?
 not far from reagan country .
 and now we 're at the point of really disliking each other , the people in our office -- the mets-yankees .
 get aroused .
 how do you deal with employees and relatives ? the pilot -- his wife and -- do you have a team that goes to them ?
 you do , too , char ?
no , or an interview or something , yeah . i think when you 're under fire , today , maybe fifteen years ago , not today .
 but you like him just as much as before ?
 and at age two months your parents put you in your own apartment with a baby nurse , why ?
 and you beat '' monday night football '' and howard cosell was depressed .
 how about the secretary of defense ?
 does n't go away , does it ? you guys never let up , do you ?
 or athletes playing ball .

 you 're not going to ...

 the broker goes with them , right ?
so , we do n't know if that is the way he looks .
 marc , we only got 15 seconds . can a kid be taken inside a school ? have you heard of that ?
 when you live to be 100 and you are ill at the end -- how would you describe it ? was it very sad ? it was n't tragic .

 myrtle beach , south carolina . hello .
 related to the mankiewicz 's ? wagner : yes .aaron spelling produced that , right ?
 does that put more pressure on you , derek ?
 but millions do n't . and they go and they have -- they have ...
 what 's that like for you ? macdonald : well , it 's interesting , larry , because most people get to know each other and there 's a physical attraction , and they know each other physically before they really develop any kind of an emotional bond . when you meet someone and then you meet them again later in life , and i 'm incarcerated and she 's not , it 's almost all emotional . and what you find out is it 's very intense , but it 's different . it does n't have the day-to-day physical pleasures . it does n't -- you ca n't come home at night and have her cook dinner and you ca n't surprise her with a gift . but what you do is you share everything on a very deep emotional basis . you talk . i 've asked my best friends , what 's the longest talk you ever had with your wife ? they 'll say an hour . a car ride . and i 'll say , have you ever talked to your wife six hours with no tv , no radio , no books , no one else in the room , just you and her talking for six hours ? they say , no , i 've never done that . i do that every weekend . every weekend . i see kathryn . and we share everything . her life ...you can touch , right ? or can you touch ?
 ace ?

 all right what , captain davis , did he do to prevent that when the front wheel touched down to prevent that plane from swerving ?
 david , quickly , you got a long shot ?
 how did he escape when they chained him in chains and dropped him in the hudson bay ?
 do you , during this period of time , date ?
 come on , bobby !
 what do you make of it ?
 you could ?
 probably the most talked about thing in america today is the trials and tribulations of kobe bryant . remaining with us is jameika williams , kobe bryant 's former girlfriend . she 's here in los angeles . in tucson , arizona , is tony kovaleski , investigative reporter for kmgh-tv in denver . he 's covered this from the outset . in new york is nancy grace , the anchor of '' closing arguments '' on court tv and a former prosecutor . in atlanta , the well-known defense attorney chris pixley . and in new york , dr. henry lee , one of the world 's foremost forensic scientists , author of the new book , '' blood evidence : how dna is revolutionizing the way we solve crimes . '' he 's a former connecticut state commissioner of public safety and professor of forensics at the university of new haven.all right , tony , get us up to date with the latest . what do we know ?
 you ca n't get them , milton ?you will not smoke ...
 do we know how many people could give and do n't ? in other words , do we know ...
 what happened ?
 it makes no sense sometimes ...
 probably have cleopatra in mind .
 curiouser and curiouser.do you think that she might break down in all -- in your studies in the past , judge pirro , break down and admit it all ?
 if he had ...
 you mean it was n't funny ?
 he 'd be right there .
 you wrote : '' my first impression of george bush was one of total self-confidence . he 's quite simply the cockiest guy i have ever met in my life . '' meaning ? cocky meaning that he does n't think he 's ever wrong ?
 ... telling people what they can do ?
 hold it..
 what about professor tracey 's point , charlie brennan , that none of this is relevant until evidence is presented and a trial is held ?
 i hear you fine , mr. cheveaux . how do you feel about all of this ? you got so famous and you gave it up .
 i mean no foul play in her room .
 hit him somewhere around ten times .derek took the hits , but i was the one that gave him the ideabut later , they changed their story and blamed this man , rick chavis , their father 's friend , with the killing . the boys also said that chavis , a convicted child molester , had been sexually abusing alex .
 thank you both very much . mort zuckerman , the editor-in- chief of '' u.s. news & world report '' and eric alterman , media columnist for the '' nation '' magazine . we 'll be back with our panel , her majesty queen noor , george mitchell , and john roberts . you 're watching larry king live . do n't go away .we 're back with our panel , your majesty queen noor is in washington . do you think this push is the final push , the israeli push , before a genuine cease-fire ?

 they 're in it for money , there 's obviously something really wrong .
 do you feel a bond with chris reeve .
 that 's dying .
 what 's your hobby ?
 what do you mean ?
 we 'll ask them later .
 did you ever think of backing off ?
 always great seeing you .
 but this gives you other scripture to think about . i mean , it 's very interesting ...
 this was taking place over a number of months and years ?
 it 's logical to be afraid of something .
 they say , we will train ; you would go ?
 correct .why do n't you wear braces ?
 do you want them -- you do n't want then to be namby-pamby though ?
 do they ever issue commands , these voices ?
 and then they could n't prove , vinnie , that someone else did it for robert blake .
 and what a story . where were you when -- when john passed ?
 ten ?
 that 's great.lets get a call in.oklahoma city , hello .
 has -- have you ever heard of anyone taking diprivan at home ?
 what was your feeling ?
 why is it our business , leeza ? why do we have to know private lives ? gibbons : i do n't think we have to know , but i think people vote with the numbers , and that we want to know . we certainly do n't have to know . you talk about something good coming out of this , i think those of us who are married treasure our mates more than ever , we treasure the trust we have , we treasure , you know , the length of the time that we are together , and the growth and the experience of it . that 's an interesting component .
 we 'll be right back .
 it 's good to have a crush .
 dr. lee , what do you make of forensic evidence from duct tape ?
 watched all of it .
 did you ever feel sorry for them ?
 is it just , jerry , as you read this , a belief in christ , or must -- that you live pure -- with no impure thoughts and everything ?
 diane sawyer , that 's part of the trial . how do you feel about that ?
 how are you .
 mad or sad ?
 but you never said to yourself , because i 'm this color , i 'm going to have less of a chance to make it ?
 have you been to that part of the world ?
 but what about right now , dr. akhter , on scale of one to 10 , how prepared is this country ?
 you 'll be out campaigning ?
 he loves them as much as he loves you .
 aisha , is there a part of you that wants her to succeed as a girl ?
 by yourself ?
 do you believe that , james ? van praagh : i think , also -- but i want to go back to instinct . in ways i do . i think that instinct is who we are . it 's our sense of knowingness . it 's who we are born with . it 's a fabric that we 're cut from . it 's how we 're made . and the more we know ourselves , the more we use that muscle , the more we develop ...some people have instinct to make bad decisions .
 how did you hear about the court ruling ?
 she 's going to be 90 .
 why , though -- ok , you want to kill someone , you 're crazed , you 're a little nuts , girlfriend drops you , why do you kill innocent people ?
 laura , true that supposedly the stepfather was angry that riley would n't say please and yes , sir ?
 you mean , people came and produced evidence -- they did a courtroom ?

 do you think that 's too many ?
 you want to tell us who ?
 what i 'm getting at , is when you experienced that , do you experience it emotionally , the death of someone , making love to someone ? do you experience that while you 're on the walk ? maclaine : yes , the vision pictures that you see , or that i saw , was of being a gypsy moorish girl brought into the court of charlemagne , was his lover , among many others . he had many . the soul of that man , charlemagne , came later , had a future life as olof palme in sweden . i had a relationship with him , and ...so you continued with him in a karma situation .

 you believe it ?

 make it easy for him to stalk you ?
 there is parental responsibility , you do n't blame child agencies as much , they get overwhelmed , right ?
 ivan , is it -- is it all beginning to wear on you ?
 but they were -- they said in the last one it looked like they were having more fun than making a movie .
 you follow your own method ?
 tito , do you go get into the swing of it , so that you forget the cameras are there ?
 aissa , there 's no doubt they 're going to ask for change of venue , right ?
 you told me early on how much you liked this job . that was before 9/11 . after 9/11 , you told me how you were sort of caught in everything ,
 because everything comes out . that 's what happens when you ...
 this is special edition of larry king live , following the president 's first-ever primetime address to the nation . he chose stem cell research as the topic . joining us now from colorado springs is dr. james dobson , founder and president of focus on the family . your reaction ?

 thanks , wolf , right atop the scene.let 's meet our panel and kick things off with our various panels throughout the hour . we 'll get right to the latest with john king , the anchor of cnn 's '' state of the union '' and cnn 's chief national correspondent.we 're also joined by tavis smiley , the host of '' tavis smiley '' on pbs , '' the tavis smiley show '' on pri and author of '' accountable : making america as good as its promise . '' we 'll be joined shortly by david gergen , cnn 's senior political analyst.we 've seen all the maps -- john.any -- anything definitive here in virginia other than the republican sweep ? does it have a national bearing ?well , democrats will look at it closely , larry , for any lessons they need to learn heading into next year 's midterm elections . and republicans , of course , will look at it to see what they should learn to try to maximize on the win here and carry it over.let me just show you a few things . this is 2008.remember all this blue ? barack obama was the first democrat to win virginia since 1964.i 'm going to show you just a couple of things.here 's the washington suburbs.remember the blue ? that 's barack obama . that 's where most of the people live.look here in central virginia . remember this blue . and look down here , as well . you see some blue down here and some blue down here . now , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to turn this off . remember this again . inside the circles are blue . now we 're going to switch to this election , the election for governor we 're going through right now and look at all the red . this is the republican candidate winning in places that barack obama won last year and in some of these places , larry , by significant margins.so what do you read from that ? is it a rejection of president obama ? of course not.but is it proof that the president was not able to create his coalition again in virginia this year as he was last year ? democrats will look at that.does it prove republicans did better with african-americans ? at least a little bit . and they did much better tonight , larry , in virginia among independent voters than last year.so it 's a state race . it 's for governor . but it 's very close to washington , d.c. we know the economy was a big issue and people are not happy . when people are not happy about the economy , they hurt the party in power . it 's the president 's party -- not the president , but the president 's party -- that has the most at risk in next year 's midterm elections.so is this a big national message ? no , but it is a national lesson .tavis smiley , is this a question of is it the economy , stupid ?
 rebuild the store ? burrell : i would n't mind bringing the royal butler range to america or the butler 's pantry or having that little slice of martha stewart 's pie . i believe she does n't have a big a pie as she used to have .would you like a media career ?
 and would you tell that to them ? in other words , if i told you , hey , judy , i 've got something terrific for you . it 's confidential . would you have to tell me i 'm going to tell my editor larry told me .
 gotcha .

 unlike the past when eisenhower came aboard , david , he had opinions that wafted back and forth , except there was no 24 hour networks . there were no nine candidates running against him . there were no big political debates and a different system , right ? so eisenhower could have weathered a storm clark may not .
 tampa florida , hello .
 is it also true that your father 's first consideration was minimal loss of men ?
 all right , it 's safe to ask this , then -- do you have an act ? you ca n't just go on stage and sing one song after another . right ? do n't you need an act ?
 that was when you were praying for him to just come out of a coma .
 hi .
 ... and it was before the fact . now , according to illinois law -- and they 're going to go the supreme court , apparently -- they can bring it in , by illinois law .

 do you think when you walk in , or people turn on the television tonight and see you , you start with two strikes .
 take us inside that -- take us inside that culture of the vendors down there . i 've been in times square many , many times when i 'm in new york city . and you 're the eyes and ears . you are obviously trying to sell your wares , trying to get tourists to stop and talk to you and buy from you . and yet you 're the best set of eyes on the ground to suspicious behavior that probably even know more about what 's happening on any given corner than the police department .
 you play a handler for a bratty teen in a photo shoot in '' harper 's bazaar . '' you talk about hollywood entourages in that -- in that article , you dish about publicists . you say some are delusional , your publicist , stephen huvane , how did you decide that he 's your publicist ?
 you would n't mind it if he did that , left the ranch for two years ?
 all right.then how will -- will you ever answer questions ? i mean what -- where does this go ?

'' tonight go inside the legend to meet the man that thrilled and chilled us like nobody else has , the one , the only alfred hitchcock as you 've never known him next on larry king live.pat hitchcock is not the only child of alfred and alma revel hitchcock , she was an actress and producer herself , was in three hitchcock films , '' stagefright , '' '' strangers on a train '' and '' psycho , '' also appeared on tv 's '' alfred hitchcock presents '' and is co-author of '' alma hitchcock : the woman behind the man .

 thanks , joe . senator joe biden , democrat of delaware . biden : thank you .john king in washington , what did you make of his performance tonight ?i thought he had a very strong performance , larry , and i think he 's a very interesting candidate in this regard , that he does have this plan , essentially to have a weaker federal government and have the -- split iraq in three provinces that answer to a federal government but essentially have autonomy , the three provinces . and if iraq continues to go south , that plan may get more and more eyes turned to it , if you will , as people say what are we going to do now that the bush plan is clearly not working ? i spent the day the other day with jim baker , the former secretary of state from the first bush administration . he thinks that plan , the biden plan , would be a disaster . he thinks turkey would come in because of the kurds , iran would come with the shiites and there would be some kind of a regional war.but it will be more and more debated unless the situation in iraq gets better in the near future.so senator biden may be on the fringe of the leading candidates right now , but because he has a plan in iraq -- a controversial plan -- and because he is so strong-spoken about it , he could have a role , a bigger role , as this campaign plays out .amy holmes ?

 ivantor ( ph ) is the famed founder of flipper , who 's an old friend of mine . he told me that he trusted animals more than humans as long as they were fed . he would walk into wild animals easier than to hollywood film producers .
 jean casarez , she is i gather highly respected . do you think she just got excited here and jumped the gun , jean ?
 and you 're going to be -- it 's going to be trump slots ?
 on 171 stations .
 senator , a lot of people are flying tonight . i think it 's the busiest night of year . do you have any concerns ?
 did she think that ? allred : she did n't know what he would admit or what he would deny or what he would say . the point of taping the telephone conversations with scott , and her talking with him on the telephone , was to see what he would say . that might , in fact , lead to his elimination as a suspect or it might mean that he would be a person ultimately charged with a double murder .got you . so to this point , though gloria , when it all comes to substances , we have shown that he is a cad , not the nicest person on earth , and he lies . and that she had sex with him , and was involved with him . but nothing shows that he 's a murderer , is that -- you do n't know if he 's a murderer , do you , gloria ?
 now , once it was announced that you were released on home confinement , it got a little nuts outside your house -- media and fans . i think we can see a clip of this . let 's watch .

 hi .
 do you still have a strong optimistic view about this country ? cronkite : oh , sure . and i think that maybe we have got our focus a little better now on what we need to do in this country . thanks to nine -- september 11 and the enron situation . i think that enron thing has awakened us to this matter of greed . i think 9/11 introduced us to the fact that maybe we had the wrong priorities in life to live . putting those two things together , we just might be -- find ourselves moving ahead in this century in a way that i really had n't expected us to . i was a little depressed for a while , and i may be still somewhat depressed about the one thing that we ca n't seem to get a handle on and that 's war . and armaments , we are going to spend now billions upon billions more for armaments when we ca n't have enough money for schools and education , health and all of those points . and all of this is in order to better be able to kill masses of people . now , what the devil is civilization about after all these thousands of years that man has been walking upright ? that we still believe that that 's the way to settle an argument ? not only a personal argument so that everybody can have a gun in their pocket , but also countries spend their fortunes on their military . if we could n't -- we spent some portion of that , in fact a large portion of that on ways to achieve peace.for instance , right now , we ought to be putting billions of dollars into a marshall plan for the middle east , particularly in the arab nations that we were going to prevent future attacks , terrorist attacks and enmity of those nations is to help them come into the 21st century . and they need a lot of funds and money to do that . we can do that . we did the marshall plan . we rebuilt europe after world war ii .a lot of people were against it .

 lorraine , ohio , hello . caller : hi . i would like to know -- i have a question about men who go after children . how do they pick -- the mother of their intended victim , what does the mother look for , what should she look for and what kind of personality is that ? and i 'll hang up so i can listen .gregg , you want to take that ? mccrary : sure . some offenders do access kids through a mother , and they come -- and i think we just had this in one of the florida cases where the child-killer was dating the mother . a lot of times they will approach . if that individual is psychopathic , it can be very tough for the mother to pick it up because he 'll be charming . he 'll be -- they 'll love the attention and the affection that he 's showing , but he 's doing it to manipulate the parent in order to get access to the kid . so , it 's a real issue . just looking at the background , i think , and being aware of lies and deceits and any of that . and playing -- i mean , dr. stout 's book , she makes a very valid point about one of the characteristics is playing sort of the role of the victim or -- i forget how you phrased it there . the pity , the pity approach . and that 's very common i 've found in these individuals who elicit sympathy . they play the role of the victim and they become sympathetic characters , and women want to be nurturing and they bring this guy in and look after him . it is all a ploy .in other words , they 're good at this ?

miss him ? easy to miss him .
 how did that get you out ?
 what happens if we do n't find him , senator feinstein ?
 someone told you that ?
 while the stories were going on -- and there were always stories -- by the way , how do you deal -- forget this for a minute -- we discussed this once in the past -- with being a tabloidish figure ? who martha stewart dates , how martha stewart treats people , who martha stewart is , how do you deal with -- how do you function ?
 no , but they must have a lot of question .
 of course .
 is he -- well , would he be in your administration , dick ? we miss him around washington . would he be in the cabinet possibly ?
 today , that probably would n't happen , right ?
 but america should try to broker something here , right ?
 you were n't in the mob ?
 and he heard things .
 on the who ?
 so you would favor the death penalty if he did it and if he 's convicted ?
 marc , it happened to your daughter . why do you think that guy killed your daughter ?
 why did she let him control her ?
 all right .
 do you date now ?
 senator brownback what do you say ? i think it also points out how desperate north korea is and how we really need to confront them on a global basis . i 'm glad the japanese are leading the effort at the united nations . but this needs to be a global effort including the chinese and the russians to confront the north koreans to stop doing these provocative acts . congressman weldon , how do you see it ? we had put language in the bill calling for us to move forward with a limited missile defense capability and thank goodness we did that with both democrat and republican support because in spite of the veto three years later north korea launched a taepodong over japan 's sovereign territory.we tracked that missile with our egis system and even though it did n't go to completion the cia was totally fooled . they were n't aware that north korea had a three stage missile capability.we were aware of the nodongs . we were aware of the scuds but not the three stage taepodong . now that was eleven -- the nie was eleven years ago but the actual test was in 1998 , so this system has been continuously in development and unfortunately now kim jong-il is doing this to try to get the attention of the west and to try to shake us into a position of responding to him.i do n't think the system is one that we have to worry about today but thank goodness , as sam said that we deployed a system with bipartisan votes in spite of the administration 's opposition in 1999 that had 103 democrats join the majority of republicans with a veto- proof margin to deploy national missile defense . that 's the very capability you 're seeing put in place today .john king might we be overplaying this ? is this huge ?well , might we be overplaying it as far as to any direct threat to the united states ?yes .sure . is it huge though ? his missile may not have worked , larry , the first test of this long-range missile but indications are and cia analysts will tell you this , administration officials at the white house believe this that he will test again , a ) to prove the system , to try to prove the system and , b ) to get past this humiliation , the defeat of having a failed missile launch . are we overplaying it ? he ca n't deliver a nuclear weapon to the united states just yet but he has six , eight or more nuclear weapons . he has them . he has them just a few feet , if you will , from one of our key allies , south korea . he 's in the neighborhood of japan . he has a deteriorating relationship by most accounts with china and he is very unpredictable to be kind and he has six , eight , perhaps more nuclear weapons and he 's trying to build more .is the white house , would you call it , ed , playing this sort of laid back ? ed henry , cnn white house correspondent : a little bit . they are . obviously it 's in their interest to downplay it but also i think they were burned by what happened in the months leading up to the war in iraq and they faced these accusations that they did n't -- they were thumbing their nose at the united nations that they did n't give diplomacy enough of a chance.as you just heard senator brownback say , you know , diplomacy really has to work here and that 's why you keep hearing from the president on down '' go back to these six party talks . '' they 're really trying to make sure it 's multilateral.it 's not just the u.s. and north korea sitting down and really trying to give diplomacy a chance because they were burned by the fact the accusations that they did n't give it enough of a chance and that they seemed hell bent on going to war in iraq .we 'll take a break . when we come back , we 'll talk more about this man kim jong-il , talk about him with madeleine albright , who met with him for some time . richard roth will check in with doings at the u.n.lots more to go too , do n't go away .

 did n't he also campaign , stephanie , against dying in military action ? miller : but tanya makes a good point . this is always what he said , larry . and again , i guess i am of the camp of giving the president the benefit of the doubt . he 's been in less than a year . this is another giant mess the bush administration left him . and if you read '' the new york times '' article , it seems like this is a very well thought-out strategy . i do n't know if it 's going to work or not , larry . but it does seems like he really has -- he understands the cost of the war , both human and cost-wise . he said , when general mcchrystal comes back , it 's not going to be about more troops . it 's going to be about drawing down and to what extent we 're drawing down.i say give this strategy a chance . i think he refuted , larry , that vietnam analogy you talked about , by saying they did group and attack us from there . that is different than vietnam . give him a chance to finish the job .penn , if president bush has done the same thin -- well , he would n't have picked an exit date . but if he had done the same thing , would you be climbing -- would a lot of americans be climbing all over him ?

 sinatra , the daughters are putting on a show at radio city .
 and julian epstein -- i 'm sorry , but i 've got time problems here . julian epstein , do you have a question or a comment for jim ?
 some of the right wing , some , are saying that the media , all of us included are overplaying the prison story . do you self-examine that , and are we ? brokaw i think what happens in this very crowded spectrum in which we now live with cnn and msnbc , and fox news and the three networks going all the time and all-news radio going all the time that the screen is crowd would images when there 's a big story like that one and it seems like every independent agency is just playing it again and again and again . and what they 're responding to is the accumulative effect . the fact of the matter is that that is an important story and an enormous scandal because there were three big reasons for the united states to go to war against iraq . weapons of mass destruction , the connection to terrorists and that we were going to establish a kind of higher moral ground there . well , weapons of mass destruction have not been found , the direct connection to al qaeda and terrorist organizations has not been demonstrated , clearly , in the mind of a lot of people and then the moral ground gives way when you have the kind of humiliation and abuse that we saw in those photographs . and the islamic culture , there really is no greater insult , especially to a man than to be humiliated in that fashion . and there were not just one or two incidents it turns out , that there are hundreds of them and they went on for many days and many hours and we still do n't know who was fully responsible.so , it was a big story and i think that what you 're seeing in the administration 's response to it is that they take it very seriously and they now think they have to do something as dramatic as take down abu ghraib prison . when i was there last summer i drove by it and i remember thinking at the time , the horrors that must have gone on there under the regime of saddam hussein . and they were must worst than what we saw here . but for the united states to be involved in these kind of abuses , just ricochet around the islamic world . and i think , personally , that it was a setback in our already-losing battle for the hearts and mind of many people .last night on this program bob woodward said iraq will be the deciding factor in this election . do you agree ?
 to o.j . simpson 's guest house .
that you could find in any industry .

 what 's your read on this whole race so far , this barack obama , hillary clinton -- what 's your overview ?
 ... what do you think about michelle obama ?
 do you get involved in what stations you 're on ?
 it 's always a great pleasure to welcome him to larry king live , senator robert byrd , democrat of west virginia . senator byrd , did the president say anything tonight that might have changed your mind ? he continues to demonize saddam hussein . i agree with all of that . nothing new in that . but what he does in doing that is he obscures the fact that the united states senate is being asked to vote on a resolution which puts the stamp of approval on the bush doctrine of preemptive attacks and preventive war . i think that 's wrong .what then is the answer ? what is the answer to despots like hussein ? byrd : well , the answer is to get the united nations to take a stand and to join in the effort , give the inspectors a chance to -- again , to go back into iraq . and continue to try to get allies . after all , during the '' desert storm '' 10 years ago , we were left to pay about $ 7 billion out of a total of $ 61.1 billion as a cost of the war . what are we doing now ? try to get help from other countries ? we 're not doing anything . we 're saying to them , we 're saying to the united nations , if you do n't do it , we 'll do it . now , it seems to me that that puts a new face on america . here we are , a nation that is always appeared to be a nation of justice and liberty and respect for law , but here we 're now saying if you do n't do it , we will . we 're making ourselves look like the bully in town .senator , if the u.n. adopts such a resolution and hussein does not comply , is n't that the last resort ? is n't -- do n't we have to go in then ?
 you were paroled , right , al ?

 we agree that there was there a holocaust . mahmoud ahmadinejad , president of iran ( through translator ) : ok , bear with me .ok , no . i 'm not . ok. was there a holocaust ? ahmadinejad ( through translator ) : you want to impose your viewpoint on me -i normally do n't like to get argumentative , but that really drove me up the loop .i 'm jewish . i have had relatives , cousins that were killed . how can you deny was is an obvious fact ?the fact that i 'm jewish , that had nothing to do with it . what frustrates me is when - when i ask a simple question , all there can be is , no , i do n't think there was a holocaust . two days prior , we had had breakfast . he says , we always look forward to having you . we know it will be fair and it will be wonderful . i said , i look forward to it , too .when you acknowledge here tonight that there was a holocaust , that 6 million jews were exterminated by the germans . that 's all i 'm asking . ahmadinejad ( through translator ) : well , what exactly does this have to do with palestine ?do you agree there was a holocaust ? ahmadinejad ( through translator ) : allow me to raise the second question and you 'll get your answer .are you denying that a holocaust existed ? ahmadinejad ( through translator ) : you can not violate the rights of the audience ( ph ) .oh , i understand it , but all i wanted to know is do you agree that there was a holocaust ? that 's a simple yes or no .i do n't think he 'll let me do him again . ahmadinejad - that was something .wrenching events has convulsed the middle east .attack , counterattack , revenge , retribution .someone said to me , you could be a diplomat . you could be a peace broker .together for the first time ever on television , jordan 's king hussein , israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin , and plo chairman yasser arafat talk about peace in the middle east .very interesting night , intellectual night , thoughtful night . as bill clinton told me , he 's not sure it 's solvable . he came very close . arafat turned that deal down . i still do n't know why arafat turned that deal down .

 look at statewide numbers . we 've moved up to 95 percent . senator clinton holding a 51 percent to 49 percent lead . it is a narrowing lead . now 11,000 there plus 6 , 17,000 votes , narrowing lead because of what 's been happening in lake county . remember , we were stuck at 28 percent for the longest time . we now have twice that in lake county , 56 percent , senator obama winning 65 percent to 35 percent . his margin has slipped just a little tiny bit up there . there you have a 20,000-vote margin , a little more than that , with 56 percent of the vote in . remember that margin right there , 20,000 , a little more than that , with 56 percent of the vote in . now let 's pull back out to statewide.and there you have about a 17,000 margin there . it 's getting late . check my math , please . i think that 's about 17,000 there . so there is the potential , with 5 percent of the vote outstanding , for barack obama to make it up . most of it would have to come right up here . as we get more of the vote in , 44 percent of the vote still to be counted there . and there are a few other areas where we 're starting to count votes where barack obama is doing well.one it down here , monroe county , bloomington , relatively small , 98 percent of the vote in , obama winning big . perhaps a few more votes to be added to the obama totals there . and then the biggest county in the state , the population center , indianapolis , marion county , 98 percent , again , the possibility as the rest of that comes in , whether those numbers , the 67 percent here , the 98 percent here have been holding for some time.we assume that 's an absentee ballot question . we may not get that tonight . we 're waiting on that . almost everywhere else we are at 98 percent or 100 percent especially in these smaller rural counties where senator clinton has done so well . one tiny county , union county , on the ohio border , we have nothing at all . very small , but very small could matter tonight as the margins continue to shrink.and , again , anderson , the source of the drama just coming in in the last couple hours at all , first 28 percent , now double that to 56 percent , obama posting a pretty sizeable lead , 65 percent to 35 percent up here . we have to watch for the rest of that vote to come in to see if it comes in . and i 'm going to draw a line across here . this is very rough science here , but this part of the county , very pro-obama in its demographics.down here -- and this is where the vote is coming from , we are told -- up here in the northern part of the county , down here is more rural , tend to be more clinton areas . there 's a rough draft . there are some chicago suburbs in here.as we wait for the continuing vote to come in , as it comes in up here , we 're moving some decent numbers . the question is , again , with a little more than 40 percent of that vote still out , can senator clinton change the margins . if the vote is down here , she has the possibility to do that but the drama continues , anderson . we need to keep watching .
 she can ?
 you think we are going to increase our special operations units ?

 colonel hackworth , you were never captured , thank the heavens . how well are people trained in the military for capture ? the fight we 're engaged in now , larry , is a fight between mike tyson and woody allen . and there are going to be reverses . and one of the major problems , tactical problems that general tommy franks is faced with is enemy to his rear , partisans , guerrillas , the same things we faced in vietnam , cutting the supply lines . the same thing that stalin used against the german army and whipped the sixth german army with by chopping up the supply lines . so that has to be addressed.but bottom line in the next 24 hours , you can expect the battle to be joined to the south of baghdad . you will see shock and awe like you will not believe . you will see complete brigades and perhaps divisions ...right .

 senator lugar , there seems to be some confusion vis-a-vis policy and the taliban . is it the government 's policy to get rid of the taliban or to get rid of bin laden and terrorist forces that they may support ? lugar : the latter , bin laden and the terrorist forces . i think , as we speak tonight , there still is a pakistani delegation heading for the taliban demanding that bin laden be given up and likewise the rest of the leadership . and i think it 's important.there clearly may be a debate down the trail about the taliban . we 've received some advice from the pakistanis that intervention into a successor government in afghanistan is a very tricky area for the paks as well as for us.so i would say for the moment we 're looking at terrorists and attempting to isolate that situation .senator dodd , what comes first , the plan or the coalition ?

 tonight , will the latest catholic sex scandal bring down the pope ? victims reveal right here . what a priest allegedly did to them as children decades ago . they claim that conspiracy and cover-up kept the abuse of as many 200 boys quiet until now . singer sinead o'connor is with us and speaking out about her personal pain at the hands of the church.then was a massachusetts girl bullied to death ? nine teens charged in the case , accused of harassing , stalking and , in two instances , raping the 15-year-old who hung herself . students and adults knew about the torment . why did n't they stop it ? next on larry king live .good evening . we begin with a really strange story . nine massachusetts teenagers -- boys and girls -- have been charged in connection with the suicide of 15-year-old phoebe prince . phoebe 's body was found hanging in the stairwell leading to her family 's apartment january 14th . the district attorney calls it a torturous day , a day on which phoebe was subjected to verbal harassment and physical abuse , after months of relentless taunting , apparently witnessed by or known about by others including school authorities.we 're joined by darby o'brien , a family friend of phoebe prince . his stepdaughter , in fact , is a senior at south hadley high school which phoebe attended.and tina meier , you may remember her . her daughter megan committed suicide after being cyber-bullied by another teen 's mom . that mother , by the way , was acquitted after being charged in that case.her web site , meganmeier , m-e-i-e-r , foundation.org.all right , darby . some of the charges include statutory rape , assault by means of a dangerous weapon , violation . why were they doing this to your daughter 's friend ? darby o'brien , family friend of phoebe prince : that 's a good question . and it went on for quite a long time . and , you know , i think the district attorney , betsy scheibel , and the state trooper , jerry bresnahan , and mark dominic ( ph ) , the south hadley detective , did an intense investigation and did a really good job.and i think the question now is if the school authorities knew , why did n't they do anything ? that 's a question that i 've been asking for months.and , you know , they did n't do anything .did your stepdaughter know all about it ?
 and why , then , is the daughter -- or was the daughter denying it ?

 we 're back with jon stewart.and a lot of this show will be devoted to you.but this is n't funny . it 's a major story . it 's going to break tomorrow morning in '' the new york times '' . and it deals with the possibility of a relationship between john mccain some years back and a female lobbyist who he apparently traveled with . it was done by a bunch of reporters , include jim rutenberg , a very respected reporter for '' the new york times '' .and also that apparently favors were done of a kind dealing with favors for a lobbyist.a statement has just been released from the mccain campaign . i guess we 're just in the embryonic stages here , so we 're touching on it , because there 's a lot more that 's going to happen with this.the statement says : '' it 's a shame that 'the new york times ' has lowered its standards to engage in a hit and run smear campaign . john mccain has a 24-year record of serving our country with honor and integrity . he 's never violated the public trust , never done favors for special interests or lobbyists , and he will not allow a smear campaign to distract from the issues at stake in this election . americans are sick and tired of gutter politics and there 's nothing in this story to suggest that john mccain has ever violated the principles that have guided his career .

 mr. pinkas , would you accept american armed forces on the scene ? pinkas : well , i think that 's something , that 's a component that should be looked at at the end of the process . it can not be a substitute to bilateral negotiations between israel and the palestinians . i think that the u.s. involvement here is critical . i think that the u.s. is indeed , as bob schieffer said , a super duper power , and it 's also an indispensable nation , and whatever other term you choose to brand it . i think it best , it would be best to leave that issue to the end of the process , rather than the beginning .mr. mitchell , is mr. rahman correct ? was it the settlements that increased and heightened this problem ?
 did you know how that story ...
 well-stated . floyd abrams , viet dinh , and roger cossack , i 'm sure they 'll be back with us tomorrow.when we come back , senator tom daschle and then senator mitch mcconnell . it goes on and on and on . the martin county trial goes on and on and on . they 're going to go into the night . we 'll be back .we now welcome the senate minority leader , tom daschle , democrat of south dakota . are you bugged that we still say minority leader ? they voted today to not share the committee chairmanships . do you think you should be co-majority leader ? basically , we just want a good partnership . we want to be able to make the system work better . we want to reach out across the aisle , work with our republican colleagues to come up with a way that makes the system work , that does n't has the political polarization that so characterized this session of congress .with a split country , with a split election , split congress , can it work ? well , you know , the precedent in the united states senate is to reflect in committees and the way you do work what -- what the membership itself reflects . if it 's a 50-50 membership , obviously , it would then portend a 50-50 committee breakdown . that 's the kind of partnership we 're talking about : a bipartisan effort to try to direct the government , to allow both parties to feel invested.that 's what we 're doing . we want both people to feel as partners that they are invested in this process so that we can actually move legislation along for the first time . obviously , pundits will tell you that it 's not going to work , that the odds are against us , and i think we have to acknowledge that . but i do n't want to repeat what 's happened over the last couple of years . i want to see if we can actually get something done , work together to try to resolve things . and i 'm somewhat hopeful that maybe this can work .do you -- do you continue to support vice president gore 's legal efforts , do you not ?
 with modern techniques now , it 's incredible what you can do , right ?

 the overwhelming number anderson , have reported , as you put it , as the votes come in , counties report them as quickly as possible . if i 'm confusing anybody , i 'm trying to trace the lines of the congressional districts roughly , emphasis on roughly , in indiana to try to get a sense of the democratic delegate rules award based on the vote and also based on how you do in congressional districts . so i 'm trying to figure out how the delegates will break down roughly in my head.let me clear that so i do n't confuse people looking at my squiggly lines on the map . almost everywhere else , again , we 're still waiting on the very small rural union county . everywhere else in the state -- sometimes you see a chunk come in like in lake county , we saw 28 percent come in all at once . that 's all come in so far . sometimes you do get big chunks.but in many places we started with one percent , then two percent , then four percent , then maybe 15 or 18 or 20 percent . they come in certified as valid results from a number of precincts . they are released as long as all polls are closed . for example , we 'll come down monroe county where bloomington is , 60 percent of the vote , we 've been stuck on 67 percent for some time , but barack obama has a lead there.i remember in this county , i started looking early on because it 's one of the college towns , one of the places you want to look for obama , is he holding his place ? is clinton making inroads , i remember when it was two or three percent , it is now up to 67 percent . there are other places to do this . you see in marion county where indianapolis is in the center , we 've been at 98 percent for some time.i remember when this was at two , four percent when the vote first started to come in . they have trickled in almost everywhere in the state , the exceptions being this tiny rural county out here and this very , very significant , mostly urban , and then down here , more rural and suburban county up close bordering to chicago . you 've been talking to the mayor of hammond , he knows this area quite well .

 the reports today from secretary of state christopher is that everything looks good , and this is an unusual opportunity for middle east peace . would you report the same thing out of that meeting ? yitzhak rabin , fmr . israeli prime min . : well , i would say that there is a great opportunity to move ahead with the peace process.let 's first say that the real story breakthrough started when egypt and israel signed peace treaty in 1979. but then no arab leader has followed the footsteps of president sadat of egypt , and president mubarak followed after him.only the change on the international scene , the crisis in the gulf , and the strong , firm position of the united states against aggression between two arab countries created realities that led to the madrid peace conference.what we -- what i , as the prime minister of the present government of israel , started to do , is first to tackle the longest part of the arab-israeli conflict , the palestinian-israeli conflict.we started with the plo leader , chairman arafat . it was followed by a peace treaty with jordan that has got the longest border with israel that any neighboring arab country . and i hope that the continuation will be by negotiation with syria.and syria , for all practical purposes , represents lebanon . and therefore , there is a good chance for peace , but still , let 's face it , there are many obstacles . there are many enemies of peace , first and foremost the extreme islamic terrorist groups among the palestinians , the hamas and the islamic jihad , the hezbollah in lebanon , and they are backed by iran . and the extreme islamism wave that goes over the arab countries and the islamic world .mr. chairman , are you optimistic ? how do you feel to date ?
 oh , and you did other things ?
 as you know .
 and you chose it ?
 but after ...
 hi .

 has it affected your weight ?andrea , why do you think the show is so popular ? baptiste : i think it 's so popular because we 're all relatable . you know , as kelly and i , you know , we developed such a great friendship on the show . and you look at the mass of people out there that are overweight . you know , like we always say , i 'm someone 's sister , someone 's aunt , someone 's cousin . you know , i am america , and i 'm an example of that . so for me to be on this , going through this wonderful experience and yielding the results that i 've yielded , and it 's just not about a physical attribute . it 's more inward and outwardly .even though you did n't win , you were sure helped .

 tonight , a man confesses to killing his then girlfriend 's 2-year-old boy , but he ca n't be tried for the crime because he was acquitted of it years ago . the latest on the double jeopardy case of michael lane with the woman whose child he murdered and more.and then later , a massachusetts murder mystery goes international , a mother and her baby girl are brutally shot to death in the bedroom of their half a million dollar home , the unemployed husband and father called a person of interest . but days later authorities have to go to england to talk to him.it 's all next on larry king live.good evening , an incredible story to begin with . two-year-old paul watts was found dead in his crib in his salt lake city home in february of 1991. the autopsy showed that he died from multiple head injuries.his mother 's live-in boyfriend , michael lane , who had been babysitting the boy , was arrested and charged with murder . a jury found lane not guilty at his 1991 trial.and then nearly 15 years later , in august of last year , lane contacted salt lake city police and confessed that he after all had killed the child . he claimed that he 'd been high on meth at the time and slammed the boy repeatedly on the floor when the boy started crying.jennifer watts , when this happened , and i know you stood by him at the time , how did you feel ?

 lanny , can this be compared to lewinsky/clinton ? lanny davis , former white house special counsel : you know , it 's all about a private behavior situation , and i think democrats have to be real careful not to try to turn this into a political partisan issue . david gergen , as usual , has it right , it 's about parents , it 's about children , it 's about why the republican leadership took so long . they did not consult , larry , the democratic member of the house page committee . they only consulted the republican member . that was a decision that they 're going to regret , because they did n't act as quickly as they should have acted .what you just said sounds political .

'' i do the show for my family , because i believe it provides us opportunities we would n't otherwise have . jon used to share that belief until as recently as the day the network announced the name change of the show and indicated that jon would have a lesser role in the show . it appears that jon 's priority is jon and his interests . my priority remains our children and their well being .

 ted rowlands , he does n't sound like a guilty person there , does he ? rowlands : well , you know , what the prosecution tried to establish in the phone conversation is that scott was acting as though he did n't understand what grogan was saying . and that sort of came through where he 's saying , you know where she is , craig ? where grogan was more of the rock in the conversation , saying come on , let 's be serious , we both know what we 're talking about here . let 's come clean . and it came on the heels -- earlier in the conversation , peterson broke down and was opening himself up , saying how horrible this whole thing has been . grogan heard that and went in for the kill . but your right , peterson did n't fess up to anything . in fact , later in the tape , peterson turns on grogan and says i 'm hanging up . i see where you 're going with this . how it played with the jury , who knows . but it was another piece of compelling audio tape that they were exposed to .michael , as a veteran of trials , you know you can never guess what a jury would do . but how would you think a jury would react as when they see someone lie , a as he lied to diane sawyer .

 all right . what caused them -- the authorities , to go a year without investigating it , and then investigating it ?
 what happened ? raddatz : they were traveling in a convoy of eight vehicles . there were six u.s. humvees , up-armored humvees and there were two iraqi vehicles , two iraqi armored vehicles.bob and doug and there were two other members of the crew , a producer and a sound man , had all been traveling in the u.s. up-armored humvees . they decided after a few miles and a couple of checkpoints that they wanted to move up into the iraqi armored vehicle to get the perspective of the iraqis.so , bob and doug and the other two moved up there . bob and doug were up in the hatch . they were exposed in the back and that 's when the vehicle hit an improvised explosive device.the people i 've talked to said that convoy had -- had jammers in it . it 's called the warlock system , which would have detected or set off anything with a wireless signal that would set off that bomb , so they believe this bomb was actually wired probably underground and detonated remotely through that wire instead of wirelessly.so , when it hit that bob and doug were exposed in the back . there was an iraqi soldier who was in a front hatch . he was also injured but no life-threatening injuries . i think his hand was badly injured and bob and doug in the back.they immediately came under fire after that which is common in iraq . they came under fire from three different directions . the iraqi soldiers spread out i am told . the americans were then able to give bob and doug medical care.they got a medevac ( ph ) helicopter there very , very quickly . bob and doug were back in the green zone about 20 , 25 miles away within 37 minutes and inside that hospital .and we 'll check with the colonel in charge there of that hospital with the condition . they are going to live is that correct ?

 we 're talking in the early '90s .
 he spoke to religious leaders of other faiths .
 why would the police not want to solve that ?
 meaning ?
 you ca n't make coffee ?
 congressman hunter , you mentioned of all the people who have served so well and the millions who have been there . you 're not excusing this if it happened , are you ? and as soon as the investigation comes out , i announced two weeks ago that we will have oversight investigations or oversight hearings in the house armed services committee to make sure that the process has integrity.but once again , larry , this is kind of a crossroads for the american media . we had dozens of incidents like this in world war ii , especially after the germans mowed down a number of our prisoners of war at malmedy . and we said , ok , we 're going to investigate those where a prosecution should take place . and we 'll do that , but we 're going to keep our eye on berlin and our eye on tokyo . we 're going to complete the mission , and we kept it in context.once again , almost a million american soldiers and marines have served in uniform . next time you see one of them walk out of an airport , thank them nor their service to the country . and do n't let anybody make convictions before we have due process , have the investigation through and have any ensuing prosecutions undertaken by the military itself .congresswoman tauscher , can we say you 're upset by this ? and i think what 's most important is i would hope that my distinguished colleague , the chairman of the house armed services committee , duncan hunter , will not only have investigation hearings and oversight hearings but reinstitute the oversight investigations subcomittee that we have n't had for many years . and that they will specifically look into this issue and be prepared to work with the prosecutions as they potentially go forward.it is very important that we do n't rush to judgment here , but at the same time it is very important that we have clarity and we begin to , i think , in the congress , assume our real role , not just giving blank checks to the pentagon and rubber stamping what they want but real oversight.and if this is more than one incident -- now we hear reports today of two or three other incidents -- we have to really understand what 's going on and we have to hold the pentagon accountable .all right . let me take a break , and we 'll be coming back with more of our panel . we 'll finish the show with all of them . let 's -- anderson cooper is off tonight . the host of a -- '' anderson cooper 360 '' is john roberts , our good friend , and he is in new york.what 's up at the top of the hour , john ?

 thanks , anderson.a special edition of larry king live . another big night for barack obama stacking up three more victories . he sweeps hillary clinton , beats her in virginia , maryland and the district of columbia.good night , too , for john mccain , although mike huckabee gives him a scare in virginia . in fact , we 'll talk with mike in a little while.we continue cnn 's election night coverage on this special midnight edition of larry king live , 9 p.m. on the west coast . and our guests in this first half hour are john king , cnn 's national -- chief national correspondent . in madison , wisconsin , candy crowley , cnn 's senior political correspondent . here in new york is bill schneider , cnn senior political analyst ; amy holmes , cnn political contributor and republican strategist ; and laura schwartz , the known democratic strategist.let 's get a perspective in case you just tuned in , were out somewhere . john king , what happened tonight ?well , larry , let 's start with the republicans . john mccain wins all three contests . let pull out the map here a little bit , and we 'll show you what it means . john mccain wins in virginia . we 're going to assign this to john mccain right here . he wins the delegates in virginia . he wins the delegates in maryland , most of them . let 's open it up , get to the district of columbia . he wins those . we 're going to assign that to john mccain , as well . and we shrink back down here , larry , and i will show you what happens.this is what happens right now if you look at this race on the republican side . you 've got john mccain way out here , mike huckabee back here . mike huckabee says he will stay in the race , larry . but watch this scenario . let 's give the rest of the states to mike huckabee . this is not the order they will vote . but i 'm just going to assign them.out here -- let me see if i can get this to work . it 's fighting me at the moment . it happens every now and then . let 's get this . let 's assign all these states to mike huckabee , every single one of them . there 's no reason to believe he would win them all , but he wants to stay in the race just in case . let 's say mike huckabee swept them all , larry , and he 's winning these states 55-45 or so . look what happens.let 's toss in hawaii , and john mccain is right here at the finish line , and he is your republican nominee , even if mike huckabee wins them all . so that is the daunting math facing mike huckabee , even as he says he will stay in the race.now , this is fascinating . let 's switch over to the democratic side . and this is with today 's states assigned . you see that maryland and virginia , the district of columbia is in the middle is already assigned . the darker blue is barack obama.and wow , look at this . obama has passed senator clinton , larry , for the first time . he has a very narrow advantage . but you have a very similar effect now , a stalemate on the democratic side.pick your candidate . we can give these up to barack obama , the rest of the way out . if barack obama starts winning , all of the states , if he wins them all , 55-45 , larry . i 'm just going to assign them all out . and the same scenario would work for senator clinton if she won them all , 55-45. again , no reason to believe any one candidate would do that . but let 's give them all to one candidate at 55-45. and guess what ? nobody wins . and you go to the democratic super delegates at this point.so if they stay close and they stay competitive -- and again , the same scenario would play out if i gave senator clinton every primary from here on out . she would end up at about the same spot just short.so for a democrat to win this , larry , outright , it needs to break . you ca n't keep winning 55-45. someone needs to start winning by big margins fast , or else it will come down to the very controversial question we 've been dealing with for weeks : those super delegates and whether or not the party will revisit what to do with florida and michigan , because their delegates at the moment do n't count .mr. schneider , we bow to your expertise to analyze this .
 there was no 911 .

 thank you . governor bill richardson , chairman of the democratic governors association , governor of new mexico.let 's bring our congress people in.congressman cox , what -- anything surprise you tonight ? on social security , he took the opportunity to lay out his principals so that people could understand them . there 's been a great effort made to poison the well , to frighten people , and so on . he made it very clear that this is a problem that 's not going away.we can say there is no crisis , but he alluded to president clinton , who took up this issue . in fact , in 1995 , president bill clinton appointed a bipartisan commission on entitlement reform . it was 2-1 democratic members , commissioners.they voted 30-1 that the current system is not sustainable . and they said that we will short change our children 's future and our nation 's future unless we act now . what will our nation think of us 10 years , 15 , 20 years from now if we do nothing ? well , we 're 10 years further down the road . the social security trustees are telling us the same thing now that they told us then . the demographics are real . the baby boomers really are retiring . we really are trying to sustain this ...all right .
 faith , concerning katrina , is it true that you drove your tour bus with supplies to mississippi ? hill : i did , with a lot of help from a lot of my friends around nashville . and , i mean , there 's so many people around the country and around the world who have literally gone down to mississippi and louisiana to help , not just give money , but to help . i mean , there 's just hundreds and hundreds of people from around the world , and that just says a lot about the human spirit .
 and looking at the man , i read this book . this book is hysterical . it 's a slice of life . it 's not a how-to book , folks . you 're not going to find handy tips on eating . it 's cosby 's memoir of a life as he turns -- you wrote it because you turned 65. you wanted your social security , right ?
 a very good question . well , during the coverage of the civil rights movement , when i first came to cbs news in the early 1960s , where it was my job to cover dr. martin luther king , as up close and as personal as i possibly could , it was a bad time in the country , a lot of really terrible things happened.but there were an awful lot of decent people who did all kinds of heartwarming things , during that awful period . black and white . and those are burned in my memory forever .in fact , they celebrated this weekend the 48th commemoration of civil rights marches of '61 . you covered marches in '61 ?

 david gergen , who has served administrations both democratic and republican , what do you make of this choice ? david gergen , former presidential adviser : excellent choice for john kerry . john edwards brings to this an optimism that many people think that john kerry lacks . he brings a freshness to the ticket , a freshness to the race , that it so much needs . and i think he brings to all of us a likability , and people kept on questioning -- and the republicans keep on saying , well , you do n't like john kerry very much . well , here 's a fellow who is likable.but one other point . i agree that the vice president does n't win an election , but what i do think john edwards can help this ticket on a lot is in the south , on these critical senate races , where it makes a huge difference whether george bush wins a place like south carolina by 10 points or by five points . if you can close that gap in those states to five , six , seven points , edwards can help save those southern democratic seats , and that will make an enormous difference to a kerry presidency , or indeed to a bush presidency .interesting . and , michael beschloss , the renowned presidential historian , analyst for abc news , what 's your read ?

'' ari , what are your thoughts ?

'' the washington post 's '' bob woodward also joined us , and graham and shelby are the leaders of the senate intelligence committee , which meant they had a chance to view the bin laden tapes before the public.you see in this tape a smirking person without remorse , without compassion . i think you are looking at the face of international terrorism and you are seeing the people that we 're going to be dealing with after we finish with bin laden , after we have left afghanistan , to go on to what i suspect are going to be the much more difficult chapters in the war on terrorism.but this is a man with obviously no feelings at all . otherwise -- you can read all this in from his gestures and his own language . it 's central to his culpability here . it shows , without a doubt , i believe , his culpability as to -- and his complicity in the whole september 11 deal . this is a damnable piece of evidence against osama bin laden .bob woodward , as an esteemed member of the fourth estate , can we safely guess you are absolutely in favor of everybody seeing this ?
 even though you have two killer drugs , alcohol and tobacco , perfectly legal .

 it is also interesting that ted kennedy thinks very highly of you and has said so publicly . you had a tough race with him .

 what was your first thought ? weiner : well , larry , it 's probably the same as all of our first thoughts . and not only was -- did i think it was terrorism , i thought goodness , there could not be a worse place than the rockaways , a community that has experienced an earthquake on september 11. and i 'm thinking well , now here is an aftershock two months later . we obviously still do n't know the facts of it , but it seems less likely that that is the case .the rescue , the teams , the firemen were very quick , were they not ?
 but he 's not gay , he was on the show --
 ok , she says about you -- i will quote from '' monica 's story '' -- '' he saw himself as a surrogate father . he never understood the depth of feelings for the president or the way in which his own inappropriate and often sexual comments added to her private pain and public humiliation .

 beigey ?
 now what about you and nbc ? are you back with nbc ?
 so in other words , if this -- if we could go back in time , they would n't start this ?
 you mentioned the organizing you would like the party to do . are you concerned -- when you look at the results , if you look at the turnout in the cities , barack obama gets 92 percent or more of the african-american vote . then you look at a 95 percent white state like west virginia and senator clinton has an overwhelming victory.are you worried that no matter who wins this nomination , the party will go into the general election with a black/white divide that will hurt it in november ?
 i do n't mean that .
 but when you first met her , what did the hand situation do to you ?
 hulk has talked about the effect this has had on everyone except himself . how is he doing ? that 's ahead .i 'm told by hulk that nick is devoting his life to a foundation to help john , right ?
 i think there 's no question that people are frustrated with the state of the economy , a national unemployment rate that could hit 10 percent as early as this friday . i think some democrats are wondering -- one of the big questions tonight -- let me reframe it this way -- who has the intensity ? democrats had it overwhelmingly last year . you remember that . well , the republicans have it now , in part because democrats are saying , hey , big majorities in the house and the senate ; why is it taking so long on health care ? they probably will get a bill by the end of the year . many of them do n't like the fact the president might send more troops to afghanistan . people are in a bad mood about the economy.it 's hard to get the younger voters and the african-americans out in these off year elections . so the republicans have the energy right now . can you project tonight on to next year ? can you project tonight on to the president of the united states ? absolutely not.but can you see some lessons tonight and some warning signs for the democrats tonight ? absolutely .that 's john king . candy crowley , give us your assessment of this , for want of a better term , puzzling first year .
 what would you say to them ? scobee-rodgers : just to take each day , one day at a time , to feel the love of family and friends and to know that their loved ones have touched the face of god , that they 're in god 's hands . they were heroes . they were heroes like our firemen and police and our military . they were serving their country . the dream , vision was needed for space exploration . and they were wonderful examples to our nation .and they knew the dangers , did n't they ?
 they had a roundtable , but that just for lunch .
 david , you 're a political pro . you 've seen these things . is this going to be a very vituperative campaign ?
 the married guy ?

 what about sickness , illness ?
 could n't they see it ?
 what do you make , just periphery , of the phenomena of teacher-student sex ?
 but murderers loose , rapists loose .

but something is blocking it . and a lot of that -- as yogi berra would say , 90 percent of this is half mental . it is mental , right ?
 continued good luck , doll .

'' and , i was just overcome like everybody else with just joy.and , as we -- we looked around . we kept looking at each other like with disbelief thinking is this really -- is this really true ? and , at that point , the governor was in the sanctuary and then he quickly left right after that . i did not hear him say anything but , you know , we had nothing to dispel that this was not true . i was operating under the same information as everybody in that church.and , as the evening wore on , we had a situation really where we had a family in that church . we knew that there was one miner that was deceased and they had not been notified officially and our concerns , and my concerns , became with that family because there was so much joy everywhere else.and so , i tried -- i left then to try to get information for that family with the company and , as i left probably an hour after i 'd been there , i got into the information sort of blackout that everybody else did . and it was n't until i went back to the church when i knew the governor -- when i saw the governor go back in did i get the horrific news as well .so , the answer is we do n't know how this started ?

 this being a pardon , governor , was it important that kind of both sides admit they made a mistake -- the girls made a mistake ?
 because you 're around people , you know ...
 that is unfair , too .
 what did he do ?
 ok , but , what do you make of being this kind of celebrity where we see a headline , you will quit the show to save your marriage -- which implies your marriage is in trouble .
 better life .

 next on this special edition of larry king live .good evening or good morning , depending on where you 're watching . and thanks for joining us . those fires still raging in california . this is a special edition of larry king live , geared mainly for our west coast viewers . and a reminder that '' planet in peril , '' which was supposed to air at 9:00 p.m. pacific , will now air immediately after larry king live at 10:00 p.m. pacific . given the latest example of mother nature 's fury , this show is even more important and one you will not want to miss.tomorrow night , larry king live will air at 8:00 eastern , preceding part two of '' planet in peril . '' we 'll return to our regular scheduled time of 9:00 p.m. eastern on thursday night.we 'll be hop scotching various places throughout southern california , picking up people as we go along . let 's start with john king , cnn 's chief national correspondent . he is in rancho bernardo , california.john , you have covered your share of tragedies and events . what 's this one like ?larry , it 's simply devastating . i 'm standing in front of what you would call a relatively modest middle class home , and it 's completely destroyed . and the randomness of the destruction is what really strikes you about the fires like this . because they are blown in by the wind , a row of houses , too hard to see in the dark here , obviously at this hour , but four or five houses in a row simply reduced to rubble . and you can still hear , if you get down low , the embers crackling still , smoke coming up from beneath them.and the fire department is worried about that . and you have directly across the street , up the hill , beautiful homes that have been untouched . the families ca n't get back in , larry . they do n't know when they 'll be allowed back permanently . today with a police escort , they could come in to get medications , if they needed to get them out of the house , to simply see if their house was still there or to get vital documents.but because there 's a concern that the winds could shirt again or that some of these embers could re-fire up , you can see ash blowing around a bit in the wind , the families get back in . and that is what strikes you most , the randomness of where the flames hit and what they have destroyed , and just the simply anxious , nerve-racking wait that so many families now still have to endure .rick sanchez is the host of cnn 's '' out in the open . '' he is in rancho san diego . i know from your days in florida you have covered a lot of hurricanes . how does this compare ?
 so you would say '' do n't use lipitor '' to people with high cholesterol ? i know that you take coq10 , which is really important . if you are taking lipitor , you 've got to take coq10 , but cholesterol is not the problem they have made it out to be.you know , to make the neurons in your brain , you need cholesterol . to make the neurons in your gut , you need cholesterol . to make testosterone , you need cholesterol . so a lot of people long-term on statins lose their sex drive , lose their ability to think , and have stomach problems.the muscles -- when you muscle waste , the little particles of muscle go out into the bloodstream . so here is the solution -- get rid of the bad oils like i was saying later -- earlier . get rid of the omega 6 oils -- corn , canola , safflower , blah , blah.if that does not solve your cholesterol problem , there is a natural statin called red yeast rice , which is where lipitor originates . they took red yeast rice , which is from the orient . they changed the molecular structure . also , eight ounces of pomegranate juice daily -- there is a study in the book that has actually proven to reverse and clear out arterial plaque , and niacin ...
 and a beautiful girl .
 it 'll make me feel a lot better than if he had no test .
 when the sniper story was going on , and you were reading about it and watching on television as everybody was , did you ever think , ever think , this could have been john ?
 did he ever get in any kind of trouble ?
 he had optimism after that , too , right ?
 patty duke , what do you think is its importance in this fight ?
 really ?
 she asked u.n. how about secretary-general ?
 have the jurors been interviewed , beth ?
 and how many kids come at one time ?
some people might have said , why not study muslims , a religion with more members than yours ? why not study judaism , a religion older than yours ? why christianity ? there are a lot of roads to god .
 oh , this is babka .
 how did the oscar thing start ?
 i mean the priests who continue to do this ?
 he was so much more than '' splish splash . '' what a mind he had .
 that 's the story of every ...

 to san bernardino , california , hello .
 andrew , where were you ? what did you see ? what did you hear ?
 gayle , no one can get us more inside than you . will there continue to be a harpo ?i think suze is absolutely right . i think no one really knows what her plans are right now . but i certainly hope that that is her intention to continue -- to allow harpo to continue . i mean it is a huge business in chicago . and i myself ca n't imagine chicago without harpo studios .what happens to you , gayle ?well , larry , i 'm so glad you ask , because the oprah magazine , is alive and well . we have no intentions of going anywhere . and that is my main job and my radio show . so knock on wood , as far as i know , i still got a job .suze , if you were running harpo , would you look to find a new host ?
 we have an email from renee in strongsville , ohio . '' i admire you for your unshakable faith . do you believe when you leave this earth , you 're going to go to a better place ? ''

 pleasanton , california . hello .

 you wrote that day , too , did n't you ?
 so what did you do ? did you come home ?
 how did it harm you , gayle , if at all ?oh , i was -- i do n't feel harmed at it . i do n't feel harmed by it at all . and what bothers me is there 's this impression that we have to '' clear our names '' about something that if it was true -- that 's what so troubling about it , larry . if it was true , we would so tell you .
 in other words , an explanation was the job he had , right ?
 he went to represent you .
 i 'm sure temptation has been there .
 are you glad that like ellen , more and more people are coming out ?
 you approve of this ?
 did you think about it ?
 you have a very good point . what do you think ? this hardly is earth-shaking .
 how many -- he did a lot of records .
 had he ever acted violently prior ?
 and steven says the same thing . we 'll be right back . as we go to break , here 's a tape of tom reflecting on earlier tom . watch . brokaw ( voice-over ) : dad was the last of 10 children . he went to work full time as a child . if it was a machine , he could run it . if it broke , he could fix it.he spent his later years building parks and recreational areas along the missouri river . his hands were never still and always banged up . i kidded , he may one day bleed to death through his hands.mom and dad worked hard all their lives , saving their money , teaching their three boys by example about work and love . ( on camera ) : you never lost your sense of optimism , never lost your ability to get up in the morning and get through the day .
 where did he get that idea ?
 it was a great movie . would you work her again ?
 did n't do it early .
 when was the last time you spoke with him ? a .
 what was it like for you ?
 and a media person .
 he was governor then ?
 and he 's been competing all of his life .
 gary tuchman , how far are you from this scene we are seeing right now ? tuchman ( on-camera ) : larry , we 're about three football fields , about 300 yards away from the scene . there 's an irony here , is that we -- me and about 150 other journalists from an estimated 39 countries -- are the closest civilians to this amazing scene behind us , but we do n't see it better than you see it and our viewers see it because we do n't have the monitors there seeing the close-up shots . however , we can soak it all in . it 's like going to a football game , an nfl game . you see it better on tv with the replays , but when you 're at the game , you really feel the spirit . and it 's just an incredible spirit you feel here as you 're watching these very historic and heart-warming scenes .and dr. bales , you treated randal mccloy , the sole survivor of sago . how did he do ?
 so why are you limiting her in new york ?
 public figures , you 've dealt with -- how many presidents have you known ?

 hack , you were a critic .

 when she spoke for you -- or at your organization -- was n't that , in a sense , how can you leave your crown aside and go speak for someone ?
 that 's standard , david , even if it 's a parole violation , where a man 's been in prison before ?
 now -- now they 're all going to flood you now .
 there 's him . and finally ...
 michael jackson called two women mom . one was his mother , katherine . the other was dionne warwick . and she joins us next .that was the incredible jennifer hudson . that 's a voice that would make some singers say i pass , i quit the business .we welcome to larry king live , this special edition tonight , dionne warwick . the brilliant dionne warwick had more hits than any -- in my memory , anyone else had , and a close friend of the jackson family.and damon eliot . he is dionne 's son . he 's been a friend of michael since childhood -- in fact , was writing a song with michael just before his death.what did you think of the event , dionne ?

 do you get letters about it ?
 you never used blue material , right ?
 certainly you do n't want to say , you 're fat .

 allan , let 's go from the initiative of , the question asker is dumb here . i am dumb . ok ? what is -- if now i can buy a home loan for 7 percent instead of 7 1/2 percent , why does that mean that phil across the street sold his stock ? allan chernoff , cnn financial correspondent : well , two different things we are talking about here . certainly , the lowering of interest rates is great for the housing market , no doubt about that . and in fact the economy is looking not all that bad thus far . the stock market , as suze pointed out , is or worried much more about corporate earnings , and that 's where the real problem is . people on wall steet are talking about a recession in corporate profits , not yet a recession in the economy . only a few forecasters are saying we are having that right now . so , it is corporate profits that really count , and thus far , wall street does not see the light at the end of the dark tunnel in terms of corporate profitability .then why , maria , were interest rates -- even the announcement being important ?

 senator barack obama in dubuque , iowa.when we -- we 'll take a break.we will check , we 'll go to atlanta with mayor rudy giuliani.that 's next.do n't go away .you 're watching a special edition of larry king live following the president 's important speech on iraq , delivered from the oval office . we 're now joined in atlanta by rudy giuliani , the former mayor of new york who has , in the main , supported this president and his iraq policy . anything you disagreed with tonight ? but we had people go there who were former critics of the war , even some democrats who looked at it and said , it 's remarkable the amount of success that general petraeus and the troops have had.it seems to me that our goal is in iraq is no different now than it was at the very beginning . the goal of the mission in iraq is to provide safety and security so we can have an ally in iraq against the islamic terrorists.and that was the mission that most of the democrats agreed to in 2003. they 've kind of changed their minds about that . i think the language i quoted actually came from hillary rodham clinton that the goal , the mission in iraq is the safety and security in iraq . and of course , the end purpose of that is so we can have an ally against islamic terrorism.if we can be successful in that , i do n't see the idea of running out and withdrawing and retreating .define success . when you say safety and the like , that is subjective , right ? we might say we 'll never be successful . it will take 100 years until you 're totally successful . how define it ?

 how much at fault are the food retailers and processors and manufacturers who get us to ...i want to go over the seven keys in a minute , but there are seven keys ? what 's that concept ? and then we 'll go through them .
 ... the democratic primaries , has it ?
 dickie arbiter , how do the people in britain measure a queen ? for example , what makes a good head of state ? dickie arbiter : that 's a very difficult one to answer because the queen does n't have any powers . she reigns but she does n't rule . the ruling is done by the government of the day.i think the popularity of the queen can be gauged really by what we saw on friday and your cnn viewers around the world saw the coverage from windsor , probably about 20,000 people turned out into a very small area to see the queen on a walkabout , on a day when she turned 80.she stopped and talked to crowds . she took flowers from children and got a rapturous welcome all the way down on her walkabout , which lasted about 50 minutes.and , opinion polls have suggested , done by various television networks that over 55 percent still want her to stay on the throne and not to retire or even to abdicate , which is not in our constitution anyway . so , i think , you know , generally the consensus is that she is a very popular lady and she is the monarchy .she also , patrick , is she not a very robust queen ? she appears to be in extraordinary health .
 no , no .
 did you inform him , or did some other people inform him ?
 houston , texas , hello ?
 did you enjoy that too ?
 go ahead .
 grandparents ?
 how is he doing ? acker : well , look , i -- i think that congressman paul actually just raised a number of very , very good points , because when we 're talking about this war on terror , we do have to be more precise about what it is we 're doing . yemen is a very different from iraq , which is a very different place from afghanistan . and until we try to get our handle on some of these internal problems and why these situations are so combustible , then we 're going to simply be declaring war on a tactic without any resolution.so i think that in terms of what you 're seeing on the president 's approach in yemen is , well , we ca n't simply drop bombs . we ca n't simply launch missile strikes . we do have to look at some of the -- the situation on the ground . it 's a civil war . and we need to give the president ...andrea , do we ...
 right .
 is this case , steve , winnable ?
 do you cook for yourself ?
 penn jillette , politics aside , is he making an impressive beginning ?

 amy , tough ?
 she was a kid at the time of that , right ? o'hara : yes . and she was a wonderful child . and she had a wonderful mother . i have read so many times people say nasty things about the mother . i thought she was wonderful . she was good to natalie . she disciplined natalie . and saw to it that natalie knew her lines . and i thought she was wonderful .when you watch that movie , everyone in it is gone , right ? payne is gone . she 's gone . gwenn is gone .
 so , it 's a process ?
 i think maybe we could be wrong . maybe -- you know , i do n't know . i 've never experienced living in a gay home , but certainly from listening to her , you would think that they do an admirable job . i do n't know that we can judge except the way we were raised . we were raised , there has to be a man .

 it was a rather -- was n't the whole thing bizarre to you and others , family related in life ( ph ) that he 's tried and they do n't know what the result of the trial is , and the prosecutors are trying two different people and not telling you what happened to him ?
 they changed the death to a non-death .
 it is ?
 how about the rumors that were -- and again , we do n't want to like to deal with this , but they were stated publicly -- that he would tell people that his wife was very ill ?

 and , of course , the fabulous opening to '' quincy , '' one of the most successful -- both these guys have had amazing careers . look at tony randall 's career of movies with rock hudson and doris day , '' pillow talk '' , '' lover , come back '' , '' send me no flowers , '' he -- and in '' will success spoil rock hunter ? '' director frank tashlin said about tony randall : '' directing him is like playing a stradivarius violin . '' klugman was active in the golden age of live television drama . he has also appeared in '' 12 angry men , '' '' days of wine and roses , '' '' the detective '' with frank sinatra , '' goodbye , columbus '' -- you two have extraordinary careers individually . but you will admit , tony , you will forever be linked .

 you 're not going to do it ?
 stacey , is this a tough prosecution , do you think ? honowitz : no . i mean , i do n't want to sit here and say it 's a locked case . but i think there is so much circumstantial evidence -- we do n't even know what the body is going to say yet . but there 's so much circumstantial evidence that i do n't think the prosecution is going to have a difficult time proving first degree felony murder . it 's not premeditation , it 's felony murder.but , again , we 're going to have to wait and see what pans out with the forensics . they indicted her . now , indictment is certainly different than , as we know , going to trial and proving it beyond a reasonable doubt . and ask some people -- you asked the question , will we ever know the answers ? you do n't have to prove it beyond all doubt .no .
 that was a smart move
 i do n't have it in front of me , but , george will , did you describe these bombings as some sort of a cave -- bombing of caves ?

 did you date a lot ? did you have boyfriends ? did you recover enough to have a healthy social life ?
 what do you do , though , with this dilemma ? and you 've been someone all your life who has spoken out on issues . ronald reagan , when you were a democrat you spoke out , when you were a republican , you were president , whether you were in the senate -- whether you were , rather , governor of california , an actor , you spoke out . should n't you , if you sit in the senate tonight and you do n't favor this , should n't you say so ? or are you saying no ?

 let me tell the audience something . our guests are caroline kennedy , bob woodward and michael beschloss . the book is '' profiles in courage for our time . '' momentarily ariel sharon is going to hold a brief press conference before heading back to israel . because as you know what happened today , another bombing . he met with the president earlier today ; at least 16 people were killed and 50 others wounded . israeli police have said the work was the work of -- the incident was caused by a suicide bomber . the explosion occurred about 30 minutes after sharon arrived at the white house to meet with president bush.neither sharon or bush addressed the issue of the bombing when they spoke with reporters after the meeting . ariel sharon will go from this occurrence , which we 'll take you to at the madison hotel , he 'll go right from there to andrews air force base and fly back to israel . if it ends before the top of the hour , we 'll come back to this program . if it does n't , we 'll leave you now . so as soon as that 's ready , we will go to it.you were going to say ?
 if you got a message for bill or me , go to cnn.com/larryking and have your say . bill will weigh in on the late night wars , too . stay with us and hear what he thinks , next .
 do -- as you know that community , and you know it well , do you expect some problems if it comes to that ? calzadilla : this group in particular throughout its history has never turned destructive . we believe that the tensions will get higher if no agreement is reached . we 're all praying that an agreement is reached where no stranger , whether it 's local or federal , has to go into that house and bring out a crying child . nobody would like to see that . and we think that something will be reached and the crowds here will honor whatever decision is made by the family .thank you , officer . officer angel calzadilla on the scene in miami . lili estefan , you 're with univision . you 've been reporting on all this . what 's your read on that tape of the boy ?

 did you love her ?
 senator hatch , you have been a maverick yourself , have you not ? your party has sometimes been upset with you . your friendship with senator kennedy , they get angry sometimes . so you know what it 's like to be a lone voice .
 because , nancy , and by the same turn , mark geragos could say , i think the prosecution 's case is phony-baloney , according to all the stuff i 've been hearing , and he could say it 's from the media .
 he would tell you to pose nude for '' playboy '' ? you posed nude for '' playboy '' he would tell you to go out and jump into the waterfall . we 're doing a water ballet like esther williams . you would do it ?

 speaking with the country , i think not at the country , might have been part of his gift.i want to take you back in time . walter cronkite goes on the air in february 1968 and he says on the air that the united states is mired in a stalemate . and president johnson , we would later learn in the history books , told his aides : '' if i 've lost cronkite , i 've lost middle america . '' will any television anchor in today 's age , when the business is so different , ever have that power ?

'' 360 '' in 14 minutes .willie took part in a great benefit for 9/11 victims and their families . he sang '' america the beautiful . '' i do n't think anyone ever sang it better . but he has questioned the official story . what prompt you 'd to look into this from another angle ?
 twenty-one ?
 do you think he is underappreciated historically ? for example , he just gets in now to the hall of fame . come on !
 but it 's that universally wrapped ?
 glad you did n't .

 michael , why are you shaking your head ?
 why did n't you talk to him ?
 so who 's -- who 's here now ?

 how much , david , did she change the way first ladies were up to her ?
 '' curb your enthusiasm '' is unbelievable .
 now , in serving , were you also , heather , doing what might be termed missionary work ? were you converting people ? mercer : some people might use the word . but i would say it another way . obviously , we are christians . and who we are is people who love jesus . and so it is a natural overflow of our lives when , in a culture where religion is of the highest priority , you come daily to conversations dealing with issues of faith . and it is just a natural progression in relationship , even -- and daily greetings , saying hello and good-bye . in the muslim culture , they often use different religious blessings in that context . so , to discuss religion in their culture is not a strange thing .but , dayna , you were charged with preaching christianity . so we get this straight , is to proselytize a faith -- is that illegal ?
 what did the press know and when did they know it , about lucy mercer ?

 so you then , no matter how this comes out , are -- you share the views of congressman armey , you are optimistic ?
 you think someone would deliberately choose this ? why ?
 the wider the scope of the roles , do you like that better ?
 so , maria , how does this woman -- we watched her in her husband 's shadow . even when he was arkansas governor , hillary clinton was no slouch . this was a very serious , accomplished professional attorney , who had to put her career aside sometimes to say i 'm the first lady of arkansas.she came to washington . she had to be the first lady of the united states , even though she could be making gazillions at a law firm , she could be the head of a charitable foundation . she had to give up her career.she emerges in the senate and then runs for president and wants to be the top dog again.can she go step in the shadow of someone else again ? can she do that comfortably ?
 would n't it -- and watching what 's on today , embarrass you to host that now ? could you host a show of coming out of behind the door , the man you left when you were 12 ?
 did n't check with you ?
 they 're offering -- they 're offering to come with all their investigators , answer any questions , present their side of things .

'' else klensch , certainly one of the world 's best known fashion journalists , formerly of style with else klensch on cnn and we miss her . dina merrill is in los angeles , the actress and vice chairperson of rko pictures . and here in new york is pamela clarke keogh , author of '' jackie 's style .

right .
 with america on the brink of war , the president has just issued an ultimatum and a deadline to saddam hussein . now , instant reaction with republican senator john warner of virginia , chairman of the armed services committee.democratic senator carl levin of michigan , ranking member of the armed services committee.christiane amanpour in kuwait.republican senator john kyl of arizona , chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on technology , terrorism and government information.former senator warren rudman , co-chairman of the u.s. commission on national security in the 21st century . he warned the united states was vulnerable to terrorists and he did it before 9/11.and former senate majority leader george mitchell , democrat of maine , was a peace broker in northern ireland , led a fact-finding commission on the israeli-palestinian conflict.all next on larry king live.we begin with senators warner and levin , both are in our washington bureau . senator warner , republican of virginia , chair of armed services committee.senator levin , democrat of michigan , a member of that committee . both met with the president this afternoon . what did he say to you , senator warner ? and now this last opportunity , where , again , the responsibility is where it belongs , it 's on iraq and saddam hussein to recognize the frightful things he 's done to his own people , the threat he poses to the world and to give him these 48 hours to pick up with the immediate family and perhaps others and leave iraq.and then we would go in , as the president said , for the purpose of re-establishing a new government to hold the iraqi nation together . and as soon as possible , depart .senator levin , you voted against the vote in october , the resolution authorizing the use of force . you were also at that meeting today . what are your thoughts ? the president has tried hard to get those nine votes . he has not succeeded . he now minimizes the importance of that . but i think we would be far , far better off if the world community acting through the security council gave us the explicit authority which the president has sought to achieve so hard in the last few weeks.the risks are a lot greater and proceeding without that explicit authority . and now the president has decided end the diplomatic approach to set down this ultimatum . i hope saddam hussein complies with that ultimatum , of course . but if he does n't , and it 's unlikely that he will , it then , as it seems to me now , for those of us who have disagreed with the president 's approach , ongoing without the security council authority with the second resolution , it 's now , i believe , up to us to rally behind our troops.that , they deserve , the men and women who we put in harm 's way are there because of a democratic decision , whether i agree with it or not .

 somerset , kentucky , for peter jennings , hello .
 is the bail still at $ 20 million ?
 and now , he is where ?
 what about the powell-cheney relationship , which you say is non-existent and powell denies ? woodward : well , they obviously meet . what i say in the book is that they have these two world views . cheney is much tougher , believes , after all of his experience with saddam hussein going back to when he was secretary of defense in the first gulf war , that saddam is a trickster , that he will play games and use the u.n. to conceal what he 's doing . and cheney believed that war , military action , was the only way to get rid of saddam . and so you have his view and powell 's much more cautious diplomatic view . and what i report , that they could not sit down and talk about this , that their views were so embedded in them that they could n't have a discussion . they could n't have a lunch , never.and probably , the person who lost out on that is the president . though i think there were some contentious meetings , as i understand it , they were meetings of the principals -- powell , cheney , rice , tenet and a few others -- and not in front of the president . and probably the president -- i mean , he knew this tension . he should have called them in and said , ok , guys , i really want you to mix it up and i want to hear everything .we 'll take a break . we 'll be back with more . the book is '' plan of attack . '' the guest is bob woodward . do n't go away .

 lisa bloom , what about the change of venue question ? lisa bloom , author , '' in session '' : he 'll probably get the change of venue . everyone in bolingbrook knows drew peterson , knows this story . i would think it would be only fair for him to get that . let 's face it , the whole country know this story too . larry , what i thought was interesting just now in the press conference from james glasgow , the state attorney , was the reference to that hearsay evidence . there 's a new law in illinois that will allow them to bring in some of this hearsay evidence.and there 's two important pieces of evidence here . one is kathleen savio telling her sister , after making 18 calls to the police for domestic violence , by the way , against him , if anything happens to me , drew killed me . the other hearsay statement is stacy peterson telling her pastor that drew had confessed to her that he killed kathleen savio . and stacy saying , in addition , that she felt guilty about the fact that she had been his alibi , telling police that she had been with him that night.if those two statements both come in under illinois 's new hearsay law , it 's going to be very tough i think for drew peterson to prove that he 's not guilty .we 'll be right back with more of this intriguing matter . do n't go away .with us on the phone is joel brodsky . joel is the attorney for drew peterson . are you surprised at this , joel ?

and died in jail ?
 welcome back to larry king live , following the president 's address . our next guests come to us from san diego , senator orrin hatch , republican of utah , who supported embryonic -- federal funding of embryonic stem cell research , and in denver , senator sam brownback , republican of kansas , who has opposed it as immoral , illegal and unnecessary . and i was impressed with my good friend james dobson and his comments , as well as those of mary tyler moore and christopher reeve ; i think they outlined this pretty well .so , are you saying , senator hatch , you are pleased with his decision to this minute ?
 do you know her ?
 and your wife ?

 how did it hit you when this first happened and you heard about it . you are the wife ? how did it hit you ? taylor : well , when i first heard about it , my sister called me and she was like , is everything ok ? i am like , what do you mean is everything ok ? she said , well , lawrence is on the news . so i turned it on . and i am going to tell you , it was like the most crazy thing i have ever -- it was like they made it seem like he went up on a school yard and snatched some girl off with pig tails and drug her back to his room , beat her , and raped her and stuff . and i 'm no , like this is not true at all . there is no way in the world . that does n't even make any sense . i was n't able to speak with him immediately , because at that time , he was still in custody . but when i spoke with his friends and everyone else , and then i spoke with him later on that evening , it 's just so -- so unfantastic . it really is .you did n't -- did n't you suspect something , lynette ? he was n't charged with beating up a girl in the school yard . he was charged with raping a girl in a motel room who was under aged . the girl was in the room , do you believe that ?
 when did you first learn about rock hudson and homosexuality ?
 andrew , now , you 'd never seen this act before . did you at first think this is part of the act , or did you know right away something terrible had happened ? cushman : absolutely , i thought it was part of the act . first of all , when he brought the tiger onstage , he said that it was the tiger 's first act . so i figured these guys are legends , you know , 30,000 shows , and so i figured that he brought -- he brings the tiger out , says it 's the first time onstage , and then , you know , all of a sudden the tiger starts swatting at him . and legitimately , i was sitting there afterwards , and you know , after the tiger , this happened , and i 'm saying , now , i know these guys are legends , but how did he go from being onstage with this tiger to disappearing and getting what looked like a rag-doll-like mannequin in this tiger 's mouth ? it was -- i mean , no one even moved . no one in the audience moved . no one ran . no one screamed . everyone thought it was part of the act .so how -- paul , back to you -- did you discover -- how did they tell you , how did you know something was wrong ? how did you know it was n't part of the act ?
 the moment when they read this thing , the judge reads it , and you 're expecting the opposite ...
 we 'll be right back ...
 so that -- that 's a plus .
 ... which may surprise some people . i have n't heard it , so let 's hear it together .
 because ? rocha : i think because we had the preliminary hearing the first year and then the end of the trial last year and i think it was because we were always occupied , you know , something to distract us .some people , sharon , when tragedy happens like to let it go away . you attended the trial , why ?
 paul and linda , thank you very much .

 rabbi boteach , i 've interviewed billy graham many times . and when i asked him about this , about death , and salvation , and heaven and hell , he said that he 's not going to judge it , because maybe everybody at deaths does find christ . so he 's never going to try to convert jews . would you agree that that 's a fair opinion to have , that maybe when a jew dies , at the moment of death , he or she finds christ ?
 do you expect to get that information , senator hatch ?yes , but how are you supposed to know what she thinks ?
 and how did he ask you and where ?
 does she have impact with you ? d .
we inherited it ?
 does that set it back a lot , if that happened ?
 we now welcome to larry king live in our studios in new york the former governor of the state of new york , mario cuomo . always good to have him with us . and here in our studios in washington , d.c. , representative john kasich , the republican of ohio , who will be leaving the house for bigger things , we hope , and david gergen , editor-at-large , '' u.s. news & world report , '' and author of the best seller on '' the new york times '' list '' eyewitness to power , '' and it deserves to be there.how do you rate last night 's debate , governor cuomo , on a scale of 10 ? high ? i 'm delighted that they are on issues now not on president clinton . and i think that 's an advantage for america , and a particular for the democrats.but so many issues have n't been reached yet , and so many of the issues that they touched were n't developed . for example , the -- secretary cheney 's answer on racial profiling was touching , but he did n't say what they would do about it.i think the two issues that senator mccain raised this evening deserve attention . how far will you go in protecting the private sector from government ? do nothing about firestone ? do nothing about campaign financing ? and so on and so forth.so i think it was a good debate , a really good debate and good for america . but i think we need more of it .john.i thought that dick cheney , you know , he surprised a lot of people who did n't know much about him . i 've known him for a long time . i think he was so effective in talking about tax cuts and contrasting it with al gore 's plan . he said at one point , you need a cpa in order to figure out what al gore wants to do . i think he was very effective talking about defense . after all , cheney , being the secretary of defense , in think did an outstanding job.it was a highbrow , high-level debate .before i ask david , it 's impossible , though , for you and mario to watch a debate objectively . you are not among the undecided . no one swayed you last night . your vote was not changed , correct ?
 so far every one of our guests thinks of their own opinion , and we have n't had a reporter yet . mr. gergen , what in your opinion is the impact of the radio talk show in american politics ?
 did n't you do '' friendly fire ? ''
 when we come back we will talk more about '' all in the family , '' larry hagman 's reaction to his friend suddenly becoming this enormous star and the impact of that show . we 'll also talk about '' in the heat of the night '' as well . others will calling in . do n't go away .

 one thing that you must get a big kick out of , right the moment before you make the lion or tiger or whatever appear , you know what 's coming , right ? so you 've got to get an enormous charge out of watching the audience with their mouths agape .

 what was his name ?
 the citizens of lebanon and the citizens of northern israel if the bombing and the shelling stops , larry . a million people in bomb shelters in israel according to the government , tens of thousands and more moved out of their homes in lebanon and they are the biggest winners there obviously.i think the biggest challenge in the days ahead is to see if the international community keeps it commitment to rebuild lebanon . many are saying they will do that . it will cost millions and millions and millions of dollars.beyond that , larry , again i 'm going to say this again the rule when it comes to the middle east is if you have a coin toss be pessimistic . there 's a sense of optimism the shooting will stop tonight but there are so many problems in this region and many say if you get a calm you have to quickly get israel and lebanon back at the table , which will be very hard because of the tensions.what about syria and israel ? what about the palestinians and israel ? this onion we could peel this onion for this show and many , many more and most people are pessimistic that the governments are willing , including the united states are willing to put the urgency , the time , and the money into it right now especially when everywhere you look in the neighborhood there are troubles . i 've mentioned some but there 's still iraq . there 's iran . we could go on and on and on .what about iran , john roberts , what 's their part in all of this now ?

 any thoughts on your former partner carl bernstein , wrote a strong op-ed piece in today 's '' usa today , '' headline , a history lesson , gop must stop bush . he draws parallels to watergate . he concludes what did george w. bush know and when did he know it ? another wartime president harry truman observed that the buck stops at the president 's desk not the pentagon . but among republicans there seems to be scant interest in asking tough questions or honoring the courageous leaders in congress who not long ago stepped forward setting principal before party to hold a president accountable for putting a country in peril.what do you make of that ?

'' he 's professor of constitutional law at chapman university law school.and finally in new york is randi rhodes . randi is the host of '' the randi rhodes show '' on air america radio . she 's -- by the way , that network is celebrating its second anniversary today . randi has said that the air force service that she served in late 1970s is where the seeds of her liberal ideals first took hold.let 's get into the immigration thing first . martha , where do you stand on all the various concepts rolling around in the house , the senate , the white house ? martha zoller , talk radio host : well , first of all , it 's nice to see that president clinton is in such strong agreement with the president on this issue . it 's good to see former presidents and presidents agree on things.but i am more of a pragmatist where this comes in . i like border security , more law enforcement , as far as those that we know are here that are felons . there are about 800,000 folks that are in this country who are here illegally , that we know are felons . and then deal with the temporary worker program . so i guess i fall a little more in line with the house version on the enforcement side.but i think that we 're scaring people by saying we want to round people up and ship them out . that is not what any of these proposals say . and we need to really deal in the facts here .ed schultz , what think you ?
 robert , is she right ?
 but was there a hit ? did someone sign you ? what happened ?

 we 're back with sally jessy raphael on this edition of larry king live . we will be taking your phone calls . you said that what jerry springer does , he does very well . in a speech president bush said they -- spoke about terrorists . and he said , they did n't think we were a nation that could conceivably sacrifice for something greater than ourselves , that we were soft , that we were self-absorbed and materialistic . and we would n't defend anything we believed in . in my opinion they were wrong , they were just reading the wrong magazine or watching the wrong springer show .
 and that 's a strong mormon belief , right ? you belief that she -- if she has passed on ...

 congresswoman bachmann , how do you respond ?michelle , were they deregulated or regulated enough to where there 's enough cutbacks in regulation to cause a lot of this ? bachmann : well when it comes to freddie and fannie , it was important that we have a world class regulator . that was missing . now we have a world class regulator . but , again , the answer is not to put the american taxpayer on the hook like we are right now with freddie and fannie . the last thing we want to do with aig is put the american taxpayer on the hook to bail out a private company with private contracts .hillary , how do you respond to that ?

'' tax collectors came , asking for that which belonged to the king , and colonists frequently said , '' we have no king but jesus . '' it found its way into the fundamental documents of this great country . you could quote the declaration with me . '' we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights . '' unique among the nations , america recognized the source of our character as being godly and eternal , not being civic and temporal . and because we have understood that our source is eternal , america has been different : we have no king but jesus.it is not accidental that america has been the home of the brave and the land of the free , the place where mankind has had the greatest of all opportunities to approach the potential that god has placed within us . it has been because we knew that we were endowed not by the king , but by the creator with certain inalienable rights.if america is to be great in the future , it will be if we understand that our source is not civic and temporal , but our source is godly and eternal , endowed by the creator with the rights of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness.i thank god for this institution and for you , who recognize and commit yourselves to the proposition that we were so created , and that to live with respect to the creator promises us the greatest potential as a nation and as individuals . and for such , we must reacquaint ourselves daily with his call upon our lives.thank you . god bless you . and thank you for honoring me by allowing me to stand with asa and lindsey and the great governor.god bless you , everyone .we 'll be right back with bob jones . dr. jones is the president of bob jones university . he 's our guest for the hour . we will be including your phone calls . that 's the first airing of this tape . do n't go away .

 let me get a break . thanks , congressman shays.we will be back with our remaining moments , including some comments from senator jon kyl of arizona.do n't go away .just a few moments remaining . let 's get the thoughts on the phone from senator jon kyl , republican of arizona.what do you make of all this ? the fact that kim jong il throws a temper tantrum should not suggest that the united states is doing something wrong , and that we have to adjust our thinking and modify it to suit what he 's done . understand that the missiles that he launched today are , except for the taepodong-2 , old missiles . scuds and nodong are old technology.they are exported by north korea around the world to countries like iran and iraq and -- and so on . but they are nothing new , and they are not a threat to the u.s. or even to japan , for that matter.and , then , the taepodong-2 apparently malfunctioned . so , his temper tantrum , designed to get our attention to sit down and talk to him , i do n't think should cause us to , all of a sudden , change the philosophy that we have toward the six-party talks and the requirement that they have got to give up their nuclear program , before we begin giving them any kind of assurances .running close on time . what -- what should we do then ? nothing ?

'' we 'll be right back .
 you wrote an op-ed piece in '' the washington post '' when you left , when you were replaced by stein and plato cacheris , and you said : '' my reaction is that a person apparently needs a passport to get into washington . i 'm not a washington insider , but i 'm a hell of a good trial lawyer . both the client and i mutually felt it would be in her best interests if a change was made . i initiated the suggestion of a change seven to 10 days before the change was made . '' is that true ?

 other candidates , would you ever consider run forge the senate ?
 mayor , do you fear the worst here ? by that i mean , do you fear a mob scene ? penelas : no , larry , i really do n't . and i think it 's been unfair to a certain extent that people have characterized what 's been happening here as a mob scene . people have been protesting peacefully . what you see here near the home is a permitted protest . people have been acting in a very orderly fashion . they feel strongly about this issue , larry . you know about it . you 're talk a about 41 years of frustrations , 41 years of having been separated from their family members , 41 years seeing their love ones lost on the streets of florida . and they feel as if the boy 's legal rights are being somehow limited . so there 's a lot of emotion and there 's a lot of frustration , but people , i think , have been behaving very appropriately over the course of this last two or three weeks .senator hatch , do you expect the rule of law to prevail no matter how it comes down ?but if it comes right down to it , senator , will -- if , let 's say , they say that child deserves to be with his father and go back , will that prevail ?

'' we 'll also be including your phone calls . do n't go away .remaining with us in toronto is andrew morton , the author of the new book '' diana : in pursuit of love . '' and now joining us all in london , ken wharfe who is princess diana 's personal protection officer from 1986 to 1993. he had a book published in 2002 , '' diana : closely guarded secret . '' dickie arbiter , is the former spokesman for buckingham palace , former press secretary for the queen and the prince and princess of wales . robert lacey is the best-selling author and veteran royal watcher . his latest book '' great tales from english history : the truth about king arthur , lady godiva , richard the lionhearted and more '' was recently published in the united states . and hugo vickers the well-known royal biographer.all right ken , what do you make of andrew morton 's new book ? ken wharfe , diana 's personal protection officer : well , i think that what andrew said , it actually sort of takes us into an era sort of post-'93 . that 's at a time when i left . but actually i think that what andrew said is very informative . it 's interesting . yes , and i agree with all , if not , you know , most of it , certainly.but , what i find interesting there is that this new life that diana was looking for , and i think she used the words ambassador was one that actually never really took off . i mean , apart from some work with the land mines in angola and so forth , it was a period of diana 's life that , in essence , actually faded away somewhat.i remember talking to diana about this before i left , and she had meetings then with john major , the prime minister at the time , and looking towards this new ambassadoral role . but regrettably , it 's something that actually never happened . and i think there will always be a gray area in that sense .dickie arbiter , what 's your view of what those years were like for her ?
